# How to configure input methods in Debian?
2020/6/23

I use fcitx, which supports Chinese and Japanese.
## Japanese
According to https://cloud-work.net/linux/fcitx-mozc/,
mozc is used.

## Chinese


## European language
I use French US keyboard. To type accents, hold down
the right "Alt" key on the keyboard.

The russian keyboard layout is different. Buy some
paste if necessary. For example, search "俄语键盘贴" in Chinese Taobao website or buy it from dns-shop.ru (keyword is "Наклейка на клавиатуру")
