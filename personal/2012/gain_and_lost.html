	<h1>Gain and lost</h1>
<p>2012/10/27</p>
<p>Winter jade,</p>
<p>I am standing at the ending scene of the October to review what I gained and lost in this month.</p>
<p>Several students didn’t return to class until around 4 am, October 8th, too exhausted to attend the morning classes. In the interval of lessons, our headteacher, the captain of them, staggered into the classroom to inform us, “The Chinese lesson will be put till the afternoon.” “His eyes are so red and scary.” Someone commented.</p>
<p>The next journey after the seven-day-long pursuit of knowledge in Weifang came in the form of attending the math contest in Jinan on the 14th. Seven boys and one girl accompanied by a teacher set foot in the capital city. The hotel, restaurants and vehicles, which we went in and out, became the main part of our two-day free-charged life. Two sets of exams were divided by a 20-minute rest, during which echoed the pity in the past set and the guess in the next.</p>
<p>Both the time limit in the first set and the hard questions in the second left a shade upon us after the terrible morning.  For me, combining the check with the right answers afterwards, I accomplished what I could. What I threw my mind to create, more often, is the following scene:</p>
<p>An ambitious girl, stepping confidently out of the exam spots, talked actively with her two partners about the past exam. Mr. Peng nodded as he listened to her report of the performance. The sunshine is concentrating on her. The wind is applauding for her.</p>
<p>An accidental chance, when Mr. Peng was giving instructions ,added to the result of the scene above. “I delivered some helping contents to the three at this time last year, and she was the only to study them, but…”</p>
<p>The journey, towards and backwards, on the trolleybus, was the same dull to me as the meeting, held on the 16th, was dull to me. But when we were informed to have regular lessons when they held the sports meeting on the past two days, we felt more dull.</p>
<p>In a different view to look at what we attended and missed, I got a distinctive idea. The school celebrated its 60 birthday, while we became audiences and got rained at the playground the whole morning. They cheered for the athletes, and we imagined finishing our homework in advance to head for a temporary vacation.</p>
<p>free wind</p>
