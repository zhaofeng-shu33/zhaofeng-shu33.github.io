Winter jade:

You can tell me your real English name as I 'm reluctant to drop a line to a cold jade in such a hot duration within a class with 32 students, though the season turns the opposite.

I'd be glad to tell you what I can remember having happened ever since the beginning of the new semester. Our Chinese teacher Mr. Zhang, together with math teacher and biology instructor, all continued to teach the new senior three, is so kind a gentleman that my deskmate has left nearly a blank of the Chinese revision instructive book by the time we finish the review of the compulsory 2. As for the everyday discipline (I type it wrongly at first, though it belongs to the vocabulary of Book 1. One needs a way to check real ability. I gradually feel that writing in English is better than practicing basic words.), Mr. Zhang stressed in the first literary class, "It's far from (being) sustainable that you stay up too late to get up before 6 am." Then he summarized the test in the harshest voice I have ever heard, which came to an end yesterday(the attribute clause should have been put behind the word 'test'.)," Somebody behaved poorly though the main checking points were taught during the summer. As it is (as the fact goes like it), it's trifling (unimportant) whether you have attended the lessons on the condition that your soul flew away."

I want to quote a sentence from Book 1 to continue the email, "there are three times as many boys as girls, all diligent and warm-hearted." but we can't escape producing the last one in the rank of the first test. Unfortunately, the bad ball was kicked to a poor girl, the representative of Chinese lesson, who seldom obliged us to hand in homework except the characters we wrote down.
My deskmate feel confused why Mr. Zhang advocated characters in a tense air of September. Science schoolwork took our countless time so that the amount of the composition papers, used to hold Chinese characters, was less and less as the vacation draw near.

If we all put heart and soul in the first-round revision, it's not so difficult to deal with the situation. I mean some students strived for the physics and math competition, the first exam spot at our school, the second at the capital of our province for the decent (not bad and not excellent) competitors to suffer from.

As you can imagine, according to your experience, a multitude of students went to the conference hall, most retreating before the time of the end. The result of the informal exam gave tickets to five students, all from our class, and (gave) chances to two anxious sonnies, considering their long-term preparation. As a matter of fact, long time ago, many, casually or carefully for a moment listened to such contents taught by our physics teacher, who has been teaching me. Though we carried it out from senior one, the final outcome attested that all the exertions(devotion) availed(helped) little. To make things worse, the crazy physics teacher declared at an urgent meeting to the seven competitors, "You are going to represent the whole school. The event is related to the reputation (of our divine school), the interest and the prospect. If you can fight into the ranks within 200, you will... (pay attention to the position of the ellipsis)" Silence reigned (popular in a time, the meaning used to express "we kept still'') us, but I, in heart, struck a tough contradiction towards the speaker, "Do we have any connection with the social students? Can't we achieve the said (said above) three without the 'crucial' competition?" I wondered (thought... strange) at the thoughts I entertained and choices I made in the past months, deriving directly from my vacation practice. When in school I mainly concentrate on schoolwork, while in my cozy home I devoted much time to what I persist in, not competition preparation, but reading and writing.

While the six competitors accepted the teacher's suggestion to abandon some lessons temporarily to study physics at the adjoining lab, I, on the contrary, have never stridden into the serene lab since the meeting. Then the time arrived when we drove to Jinan.

At the meeting, though the teacher repeated, “the ten days left should be spent wisely.” Still, I behaved every day as usual, attending P.E.class, which was deserted by those devouring competitors.
“The future of this road is studded with splendor.” My deskmate commented while sorting the mess of papers on his desk by his absence for the whole afternoon.

The endurance of our chemistry teacher is beyond its limit, forcing the lovers of physics to attend his lessons about the structure of atom. “The process of deduction(guess by facts) about element (H, C, N, O, Al...) interests me a little but the teacher's reiteration bored me much.” My deskmate complained. I found his sensation was consistent with mine.

We set off on the noon of September 21st and reached the destination after we got extremely exhausted.
We saw the astonishing slogan hanging on the narrow food street. It said:

The wicked dog! The doggy betrayer. Go off! If not, bear the peril on yourself!

The slogan is entitled as “the Diaoyu island belongs to China forever.”

“We are supposed to buy his roast meat.”...

Because of our joint failure, we bustled back in the morning the moment we knew our low grades.

Four out of the seven competitors have gained another chance back to Jinan on October 14th.
We are told by our math teacher, “You needn't have extra burden except the first-round revision.
Wining math prizes is similar to seeking your fortunes, owing to whether the questions suit you or not. Do be careful at the first test to avoid blunders.” He said while smiling at us, when we were rallied to his office to have an informal meeting.

Recently we have reviewed the complex number (a+bi). A recollection struck the math teacher,
“This year a student called Zhu Yuan made an absurd mistake about the imaginary part of the complex number. She thought 'bi' as the whole is the imaginary part, so that he lost 5 scores at the third research exam, annoying the headmaster...”

Once he reminded us of the 16th question of this year's CEE (a test determining one's future), “The body of the question says a unit circle(r=1) with its center at (0,1), rolling towards the right... do you find any improper expression in the statement?” He indicated that the definition of the unit circle of our texts was different from the above. We instantly understood the problem, and more than it.

I kept a lot diary in the ten days from Sep. 1st, some in mother tongue,
others in English, the latter of which absorbed some words from my reading. Sometimes I tried to explore another way to live, considering the fact that one is nothing but failure if he failed when passing the narrow bridge.

Just my immature idea. Maybe you could show your environment to inspire free wind.

More progress for you.
