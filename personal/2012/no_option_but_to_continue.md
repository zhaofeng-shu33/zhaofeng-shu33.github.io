# No option but to continue
2012/6/10

I'd like to show my gratitude to you, if I'm allowed to recognize you as my senior sister, for all the help you offered to me during your busy preparation for the College Entrance Examination.

Now, as Senior two students we had four days off due to the Senior High School Examination to take place at our beloved school. Some of us admired you, Senior three students, have been freed completely. But I felt at a loss, lost in what I ought to work on mainly at present.
I am still conceived in a bright future, as I did in the past. However, there always lied a host of setbacks, proving that there were no shortcuts to what I hoped to achieve. Sometimes negative thoughts including love affairs and study problems distracted me. It seemed that I could restrain my low emotions only if I did morning reading steadily.

I chose "No option but to continue" as the title of this letter while pessimism surrounded me. As I could remember, it was Mandela that gave a speech related to the topic when he was set free from dark prison. What he said was for his motherland and people, but I just chose it to express my attitude to life, a student's life. Maybe there was always a new station waiting for us around the corner, whether a person experienced the College Entrance Examination.
I used English to drop this line, partly because Chinese became my headache during every test.
