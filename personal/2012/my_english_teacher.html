	<h1>My English teacher</h1>
<p>"Don't expect two much as long as you feel pleased." This is what our
Mrs Wei said in our last formal English class. No matter how much
my English has improved on amount of Revered Wei, I cherish to my deep
heart those hard-working memories with Mrs Wei, whether she will teacher me or not.</p>
<p>Do you remember her blame on our second mistakes, or third even fourth such as the usage of the word "blame". Her thoughtful sentences such
as "You must take notes of what I write on the blackboard while you
might need to put down those that I don't write down."; and her sense
of humor how and then such as the championship of Yunlong Party and
Haodong Party when the two were compelled to copy texts so that the
whole male species of Class 5 were divided into two parties to come to
their aid. All these embody her care for students, her enthusiasm
for career and shrewdness for life.</p>
<p>There is one thing about Wei that everyone remembered as if it happened yesterday. Maybe yy, you will condemn me if I use the phrase. It was when Mrs Wei fell badly ill and you, Lu Jianping, to name but a few, represented Class 5 students, sending our best wishes to her.
I felt guilty about not escorting your fair beautiful ladies personally, just for a math class. Please forgive my frivolous expression. Now I gradually realize that one can never deny the importance of study whereas one can never neglect the value of sympathy. All in all, free wind has offered few while receiving many.</p>
<p>In terms of English, there is a superwoman in my life besides Reverend Wei. Frankly speaking, I don't adore Mrs Wei as much as you.</p>
<p>At the very beginning, I did poor in English as a pupil. I envied
those who were keen on English training classes and thought much of them as good English speaker. Although I studied a little about Cambridge English course. This name sounds pretty famous, but in fact it had little connection with the mother school of Xu Zhimo. There seemed no progress, mostly due to my naughty character.</p>
<p>Soon I went to Junior school. Drawing upon her superior English basis,
Ding Ning overwhelmed me almost every tests in total marks. It was not until grade 3 that I damaged her strength by the fact that my English had a big leap. Compared to my previous teacher, Mrs Zhang, whose husband taught me chemistry at Senior two, that young and kind-hearted teacher called Yang Huiling was so earnest to teaching us that she has no time to consider marriage. In her view, translation and reciting texts are considered of vital importance. "You are expected to recite texts and practice translation as far as you can instead of committing a multitude of grammar rules to memory." She was saying in one class, when Huang Dou submitted suspicious loving lines to young ladies. Miss Yang threw a chalk to him at once, then another. Unluckily, Huang is wily enough to flee from the trap of such kind hunter. Then she seemed to warn the most sprightly child: "As it is, if you allow your attention appropriated by one trivial affair, there is nothing you can
achieve. I suddenly fell a penetrating cold wind breaking into my heart while Huang turned down his head to hide his blushed face. As
a matter of fact, I also wasted a profusion of time playing computer games. Huang's behavior is of no difference in essence with mine. I indeed betrayed the saying "The god only praised those untiringly working." This sentence is told by Miss Yang on our first English class.</p>
<p>Once the hospital served our beloved Miss Yang but English class has to go on. It was arranged that Huang and I replaced the teacher to teach others, merely translating some "Reading Comprehensions". The
two of us can be equal to the temporary task for we have been trained to translate them when confronting the whole classmates.</p>
<p>However, no more than half a day, Miss Yang hastened to come back in order to check our reciting. "Though my throat is burning, I cannot
desert you. After all, we are the same comrades in one fire trench.
So Huang, you should set an example for others to recite now." Miss
Yang grinned at the awkward Huang. Then she signed when Huang was incompetent. "To my dismay but not to my surprise, this is why you are far behind our No.1. student in our class. Haven't you noticed his frequent calling on my office to recite texts? As the saying goes, heroes make themselves real men while --"</p>
<p>Then the rest of class continued the last half sentence: "Idiots make
themselves real bears."</p>
<p>"You all know these truths but can you not resort to exquisite words?"
We all know the truth that we should depend on practical actions.
She coughed heavily and paused. Her words raced my mind. As far as I'm
concerned, I derived not only encouragement but pressure from Miss Yang, who thought highly of me, who corrected every pronunciation mistakes during my translation and reciting, who told me and the other students that " You needn't fear preceding 30 years while there is no need to regret subsequent to 30 years."</p>
<p>Would that I could go back to my integrated mother school to seek her, to tell her and to express my gratitude to her.
For her mighty motivation, for her optimistic emotion and for her ever-lasting words after June 9.</p>
<p>Note: free wind is the penname of me.</p>
