	<h1>Cleaning the room</h1>
<p>2012/9/1</p>
<p>I went back to school today, with heart full of excitement.
To my surprise, rows of bicycles are arrayed neatly at the
park. Soon heads of new seniors from the bottom of the
teaching building came into my sight. "So it is" I thought,
running to the office of my new Chinese teacher, Zhang Lei.
He told me the position of the classroom and I, accompanied
by my dad, bearing my studying equipment, found my new classroom
which already contained a score of students. The grey white
tables are laid as our computer classroom, beside which stood
girls such as Ren Weimin, Shao Xiaoqi, etc, for there were no
stools to sit on. Shao was gazing at the reviewing book of
basic skills while Ren was chatting. But in my impression,
most students there were hard-working except the garrulous
Mr Tai, who was exclaiming and pounding heavily. I am joking
and exaggerating of course.</p>
<p>I looked around and fixed my eyes on the very adeloscent, Wang
Weijia, who had suffered a lot in both leg and psychology.
"All right now." He grinned as if nothing had happened. I smiled, too
and then turned my head and looked through the light blue curtain, the pane of glasses and I witnessed all the Senior three students were
studying. Chu Liang, a helpful and out-going lad, told me that
almost everybody had gone back and picked up their long deserted occupation. "However, we are to clean the whole dirty room this
morning, maybe this afternoon." "And even tomorrow." Wang interrupted Chu.</p>
<p>The time now is worthless and worthless and the period when we are
overworked is invaluable, isn't it? Why Sun is talking ceaselessly
while Guo is reading chemistry non-stop. Then we were all called to
move the table to and fro. Fragile girls were forced to work but
Wang sat on the only stool which I brought there. No one reproached him
as we knew his half-recovered injury. The last work we had to finish
was to borrow pairs of desks from the 6th science classes where many
raised their eyes to look at us. Some familiar, others strange, but
all ordinary. They are destined to ordinary because of their habits.</p>
<p>We can domineer to them, can't we? Some teenagers wrap the world
in their mind while we, so-called top students are wasting so much
time carrying out useless activity?</p>
<p>I think highly of Wang Peilun, fully because of her posture, her air and attention (not owing to her beauty. But I guess no one believe...) when I passed the Class one two times.</p>
<p>Now, the cleaning is over and we returned to our silence. Everyone
is attentive and that's enough.</p>
<p>I admit that recent writing consisted of little careful notion, on
the area of which I will try harder. Disagreement is better than flattering. One has rights to hold his own view.</p>
<p>It seems that our class omits the morning reading before the
breakfast. However, the considerate regulation led to some boys'
coming late all the time, Sun Zhongkai included.</p>
