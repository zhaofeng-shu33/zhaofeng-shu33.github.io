# Mo yan
2012/10/29

We waited too long for this sublime moment, until then
the condition of no flag-rising ceremony lated for a few
weeks, until this period the same lethargy in Nobel prize
for literature lasted a hundred years in China.
An eloquent high-aimed adolescent stepped forward to
give a speech about this historical event, a Chinese
writer won the nobel prize. He used many epithets and
rhyming, parallel techniques which have been forgotten by
us completely, but a sense of national pride settled down
in us.

A few days ago, I was shocked when I heard an incomplete
message about the language convention of Mo Yan's masterpiece.
The commentators of committee members only allow the work
written in or translated into English, French and German.
Absolutely, they can't read Chinese. This information left
me immense space of imagination. Combining our experience
when reading translated works, we often found it hard
to deal with the queer expression and multiple special
nouns. When the professors found many pinyin nouns, how
can they appreciate the work by Moyan which described the tough
life happening in Chinese rural areas?

Besides, translation pulled most of language beauty off.
As for us, we remembered a poem called "Farewell to a friend"
(Book 8, Module 6). Which do you prefer, the work of Libai or
of the translator? Pardon my straying a little further, comparing
to the Chinese edition with "I have a dream", maybe we can
get more inspiration. Though the song in the speech by Martin was
quoted, it still had original feathers which can't be revived by
converting the language. "My country, tis of thee, sweet land of
liberty. Of thee I sing, land where my father died, land of the pilgrim's pride." The speech of some words have to be changed to
adopt to the Chinese requirement and the rhyming consequence is
reduced inevitably. The translator did recreate the lyrics
atoning for the deficiency.

Relapse to the topic about Mo Yan, whose pen name suggests "no speaking".
We can understand, it as "Doing more". In order to practice
this principle, we will face some unpleasant structures of knowledge.
Technology is one of them. Referring to the table of related vocabulary at the end of the "Technology and Design Book". I was to summarize
what we had learned in the following passages (As most of expressions
are translated, you can criticize the improper points and put the mistakes right.)

Technology has many characteristics such as definite purpose, comprehensive extent and double effect. One point which is
examined more frequently is the patent, one of the intellectual
assets, the other two of which include brand and copyright.
Knowing what the technology is, we then should master
eight principles of technique design. They are concerning
science, practical use, innovation, beauty, economy,
safety, technical requirement and sustainable development.
The next step is practice. We should know something about
the size (including three important points and the three-view drawing),
but manipulating tools to make the painting into physical substance
seems more important. To make it, we collect materials, using equipment
of wood and pincers, and mould it with some technology.
To examine our product, we need to carry out technical experiment.
