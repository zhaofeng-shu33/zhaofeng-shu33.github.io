	<h1>Leaver</h1>
<p>Written on June of 2012</p>
<p>The day before the English test, I dwelled on the debating matters and a flash struck me -- yy should have had the ability to participate in it.</p>
<p>But how could I face her? I seemingly realized I went my own way by
overwhelming her with my so-called reputation. I happened to read those
sentences "Being human, we are imperfect. That's why we need each other, to carry each other when we falter, to encourage each other when we lose heart. Some may lead, some may follow, but none of us can go it alone. The changes we are working for are changes that we can only accomplish together." I tried to recite its Chinese meanings so that I could quote it though the quotation may be regraded as the humor of a scholar.</p>
<p>The regretful heat of students and the flames of the teachers mixed together after the grades came out. While experiencing painstaking study, we, especially students who live in dormitory, looked more eagerly forward to the College Entrance Exam when we would be free from here. Under such atmosphere, yy who always had an optimistic attitude towards working disappeared as a result of getting sick.</p>
<p>I remembered so clearly when we were proceeding an English class. The
teacher called the name of the absent girl to make a sentence. Hearty students explained the reason. Still, the teacher signed: "Since yy left an ill message to the head teacher, how can she forget to ask
a permission of leaving from me?" We also got lost in thoughts.</p>
<p>Ren Weimin suffered greater than the others while Liang Jingwen complained he couldn't finish making-sentences test paper without yy.
Wu Chenyue, as a responsible girl, undertook to put away numerous papers for yy.</p>
<p>Fragile students went one by one so that Mr Chen had to invite students from the West school to cover the seat to cheat Professor Zhang and Elder Liu.</p>
<p>I felt sad to say Mary got ill and Chinese homework was forsaken.
I still hated to put down texts though I was paradoxical. Mr Li,
who took charge of Class one, gave us a lesson on Friday. Funnily,
we transferred to the reading room where we listened to his unusual ideas for about 10 minutes. Then he rode home so as to cook for his Junior 3 son. Convincingly as he spoke, he seldom devoted to teaching heart and soul as Mary did all the time. But I had to say, a good attitude was not the only essential, while method also counts a lot.</p>
<p>Sun Zhongkai, tortured by the terrible grade, also left. He was
thoroughly a failure at English as yy at math. But for his low
score at English, he couldn't have been surpassed by Cheng Weizheng.
I remembered so clearly that he helped me advice Mr Chen that we
should hold a debate in class. I was deeply touched then suddenly recalling Wang Weijia's sincere letter, putting pressure on the headmaster to delay the separation of classes. Everyone was making
a difference to school life in his own right.</p>
<p>I didn't forget the senior 3 students, who left there free from heavy
study. They have said goodbye to intimate friends. The moment they
escaped after photograph, we, especially dormitory students engaged in
a massive rob, which happened in the senior 3 dormitory. Liang Jingwen captured a brand-new Chinese review book, which he showed off to Ren Weimin frequently. Senior 3 considered those to be waste, but they left what we cherished a lot. Knowledge is priceless. This saying
was true of both senior 2 (invaluable) and senior 3 (valueless).</p>
<p>At last, we had to retreat. I remembered the Sunday morning reading was far from being lively. Books were then carried to be restored in the dormitory temporarily and our hearts were merely locked in the classroom temporarily. I knew now, without Senior 3, we were 
front-soldiers, whether we were ready or not. But our mental states
distracted by others or ourselves often discouraged us, discouraged us from concentrating on what we were doing. Mental disorder and exterior study inefficiency influenced each other, falling us to the valley of despair.</p>
<p>Tragedy as it was, there were others standing by us. Even if we leave here, we cannot walk alone. It was once said by Martin Luther King and it is also the message of a song -- "We are the same".</p>
<p>Below is the translation of the song which I modified a little:</p>
<p>When I opened the window, I saw stars still sparkling in the night sky.
Anyhow my heart was touched by warm feeling. Flashes strived to light up the long night, whose atmosphere was so sterne. You are always the
shining star during my life. You are always the guardian of our dreams even in the midnight. This is such a big world but my love just wants you to understand and to accompany my endless and isolated journey. You
know my dream as you know my pain. You also know we feel the same all the time. Even if there is another big whirlwind, it cannot stop the courageous impulse. Let's make efforts to move forward in the sky,
no matter how tired we are. Look -- how beatiful the light is after the darkness. Share my strength with you and we will illuminate the other's road. I perceive we are the same to desire the light of the dream. There is tremendous pleasure as well as tremendous loss along the journey. When I looked back at the initial time. I found how strong you were. Your encouragement lied in my heart until who I am today.</p>
