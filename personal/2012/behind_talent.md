# Behind a fleeting blast of talent
When London Olympic Games is ongoing, my mood fluctuates up and down
with it. Excellent contest's shots, collected by media, dash into my
eyes in a short moment. This is a moment when new world records
are set, gleaming gold medals are won and also 4 years' toils are
witnessed.

In a confined event, they've been practicing countless days
and nights. Previous enthusiastic desire dissolved in a still
lifestyle. From dawn to dust, week in and week out, there is
no choice but to continue. The different manners affect their
ultimate showcases. The coachers make exercising plans for
them and the implement is strict and steady. We are prone to
admire their organized training, compared to our disorganizing
time tables. However, what we really gain may never be what we expected.
Someone dashed out as a black horse but they took the shine off
those comparatively hard-working. It happened so cruel
between our Chinese talents in our advantageous events. I watched
a report about a fragile girl called Hu Yadan, several years below
you. In the final contest, unluckily, her state mind was out of
order. The mistakes of her first and second diving condemned the
death penalty to her success --- the gold medal, which symbolized
the 200th of the China's Olympic trail.

Hu did a little better in the following divings, but there is
no point except that she didn't fail so much shamefully. In
contrast, another elder athlete called Chen Ruolin was leading
over others from the beginning to the end. While Chen is
answering to reporters exuberantly. Hu is shedding tears in silence.
Warm-hearted interviewers soothed the thin girl and showed the cruelty
to our spectators. Besides the poor girl, there are also those who
lose their medals because of controversial actions. There are also
teams who were defeated in every ball game. There should also be
a miserable man who quit the race just before the gun was to shoot.
Behind those exultation there hid so many sorrows belonging to those who are called "the defeated".

The sport career is all for them. As far as it goes, every career covers
a value which is of vital importance. Another old marine biological scientist, Liu Ruiyu passed away a few days since. His unusual contribution is without doubt but the responsibility of career, which
supported him to work till the catastrophe of body still touched me a lot. While looking back at my speech titled "Make perseverance a character", that moment of wits and creation is destined that it can't
be surpassed easily by me today because the living state is far away.
According to the standard of knowing, we sometimes throw our past away,
not knowing we ignore the process while value the result all the time.
No medicine can cure all disease. A powerful sentence, a warm memory
or even a sneaking affection have their effective dates. Even they passed
the dates, we are supposed to regain them. We are often told "No man is immortal" or "Life is too short" and it's time to bend your mind to real
importance. I dare to say those truths never fade despite of our suspicion at times.
