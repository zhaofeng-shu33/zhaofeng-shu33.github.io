# Using dictionaries

If you don't know the meaning of the word "thesaurus", how can you ascertain it? Yes, referring to a dictionary is an instinctive choice.

I ever saw your compact dictionary, easy to carry around, using Chinese
to explain English words. It gives off an impression of word to word,
which can cause the inaccurate comprehension. English-Chinese dictionary
is better because it uses two languages to explain a word. Referring to
English illustration can put right the possible wrongs in our notions
as well as review those active words, which are used for explaining
the meaning of the entry. Perhaps the main disadvantage of this kind
is dear price and bulky figure, with pages of two thousand or so.

Honestly speaking, comprehensive dictionary offers many parts, which
we hardly consult, especially verb phrases, predominating much space
of the verb entry, but hard to find what I need. I think, however,
this kind of dictionary provides for us a list of appendices, voluminous
vocabularies and capitals appealing to admirers. Vanity should be
transformed into sensible use of it. In my notion, making better use
of the main function of the stout companion is our first step, i.e,
locking our eyes on words itself. I think unfamiliar words should
include familiar look with obscure meaning. Here are a list of very
common words but they all possess themselves of other imports: blow,
wind, retire, etc. The blank of their masks interrupts our fluent stream of mind. If we had Chinese translation, we would find which word suppressing us. With the help of our loyal tool books, we can overcome
it temporarily. Sadly, we soon lost the memory of the spell to kill the present enemy, consistent with the rules of forgetting. I quote
our former music teacher's saying to deal with the wrenching situation
--- "Keep it in mind. You mustn't ask why." The method shouldn't be
memorizing some frequently but recalling the previous haunt of the word
as long as you meet at one time until you beat it. One more thing
is that the long sentences also distress us but the dictionary can
give no help. Stagnation by sentences exposed our poor amounts of reading. Except analyzing the very point, we are bound to read as
much as possible, from two languages combined to one language alone,
from our college life to graduation.

I slightly reject to ranking the vocabulary grades, with which
method our former English teacher taught us.

An episode: the word "governess" occurred to me awhile since, which
has the root from my novel reading. I think for a while and look it
up, for I didn't know exactly the tenor of it. The fact came out that
"governess" is very narrowly used to call those worked in a rich family
in old ages, a little different from tutor because a governess ate and resided with his or her pupil. Though governess overreaches the
confining vocabulary bounds set by our educators, in some readings it
appears very frequently while those with which we cram our mind haven't
any traces in the lines.

Just reciting those words circled by teachers is, in some degree, a slothful way, very unfavorable to further study. Often I check
every word in a beautiful essay then to review now and then. In the
process, I have to admit not managing well with the review process,
which seems more important.

I emphasis most on the recollection of words. To accomplish the goal,
I have found relation works well. One of the most relations is synonym,
or rather, I mean having similar imports, possibly sorted casually by me.
If lawyer came into my sight, I would think of barrister and solicitor.
The thesaurus, a kind of dictionary, can provide help in the area. But
I consider taking care at leisure more effective. In order to take notes
of these synonyms, I prepared a notebook, but reviewing this notebook
is less efficient than reviewing the essays, or novels, though the
latter needs more time.

Jumping from one word in one essay to the similar or the same one in
another is one of my reviewing practices. In addition, using derivation
to expand the boundary of vocabulary is one of our basic skills. I
sometimes pay attention to the contents above and below what I am
looking up, so that I can find more forms of derivation belonging
to the word. An obvious advantage of doing this is that you can gain more meanings from other forms which also apply to its derivate words.

The said experiences of using dictionaries are not an easy process, but
accompanied with it, helped by it, and absorbed from it I feel more
confident to embrace a broader English world.
