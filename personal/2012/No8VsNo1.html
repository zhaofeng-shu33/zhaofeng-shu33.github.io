	<h1>Is No. 8 better than No.1?</h1>
<p>Last Sunday at No.8 high school took place the biology contest,
which some No.1 high school students including me took part in.
Below are what I saw and what I felt during that day.</p>
<p>We arrived at the school gate at around 9:00. The seeds of the poplar
were flying sprightly under the shine of the sun. But they treated us
unfriendly so that we suffered a lot. There seemed to be no parking lot,
just like No.1 high school, nor were thee any candidates except a group
of us.</p>
<p>But to our astonishment, the school was running as usual --- students here
took classes and had a break by turns. It was a coincidence that they were
having a 30-minute break when we stepped into the school gate.
Boys and girls came to and fro, many of whom wore the uniforms so this
school was distinctive from the regulation of No.1 high school as far
as schedules were concerned.</p>
<p>A gaunt adolescent called Long Zongqi from Class 6 Grade 2 of No.1 high
school told us there were two canteens by investigating. But what we
really care about was the location of the toilet. As we always did in
No.1 high school, we were guided by Cao Zhen, a chubby boy from
Class 4, into the teaching building. We were almost lost as
mice were stuck in a maze. Feeling embarrassed, Cao asked a boy,
who was to enter the classroom, "Could you please tell us where
the WC is?" "All right, go ahead behind me." The moment he
had said so, we all suspected if we had problems in hearing.
To everyone's relief, he just pointed at some place and said goodbye.
What a hospitable student he was!</p>
<p>Then we headed for the place he told us, surprised and delighted,
partly because of the beautiful landscape on both sides of the road,
but mostly due to so many charming girls passing us. As for this point,
there was no need to discuss more because we couldn't restrain the impulse of adolescence.</p>
<p>Contrasted with the jangling discords around the teaching building, we found
the experiment building was very quiet. Having been delivered our exam cards,
we teased one another to kill the waiting time until the guard let us
into the mysterious building.</p>
<p>Feeling cool and nervous, we carefully showed our identity cards on the
threshold of the examination room, which was similar to those in No.1 high
school. Perhaps they served as chemistry labs judging from the tap
in the middle of each table.</p>
<p>Two hours were flying! Soon the bell rang. Most answers of the 120 questions
were hard to guess, though each was a choice from A, B, C, D or E.
It was very cruel to think that others might know how to make it out while
you couldn't, which was also true in other cases.</p>
<p>When we escaped from the examination rooms, we found the school gate was crowded
with so many students in spite of the opening gate. It was enough to prove
that No.1 high school was too small to have the necessity to open the
larger gate. Perhaps we were all frogs under the well except you went to more
advanced fields.</p>
<p>The sun went down towards the west, yet the weather was sweltering. A group
of us went upstairs, enjoying the scenery and talking discursively. We
actually hang up at the new under-construction park of scattered crew along the railway. Interestingly, the only girl among us, together with two handsome boys,
were from the west school of No.1 senior. They behaved differently, frequently dialing their cell phones and doing couple-like affairs.</p>
<p>Wise men in ancient time said your mind will be broader if you climb a mountain.
But that was not true for us. The sweat was pouring off from us continuously.
The reason why we fatigued within a few steps might lie in the lack of exercise.
Perhaps the strength of our bodies is unconnected with playing ball games.</p>
<p>So many strange rocks stood out against the white ground, covered by bluish
stones. Despite these artificial scenes there was little to have a look.
Birds had disappeared thoroughly in the past. Old trees were cut down, replaced
by economical plants. Grey sky held dusty clouds. Tranquil through the mountains
were they hid the mourning of nature under the artificial appearances.</p>
<p>We were no more than students belonging to No.1 senior members. We could do
nothing other than studying, nor we could transform even ourselves into what
we expected ourselves to be. Still, we were not heading for the valley of
despair, as long as we found shortcomings of ourselves. Correcting mistakes
took a long time, so just take it easy!</p>
<p>As we felt tired, we set foot on the return to the backward town and our school.
Poetic scenery brought nothing to m, for there lay a pile of homework to be done in the self-studying places. We especially worried about the composition of
Mother's Day. "The second of headache is math, so much to exhaust our energy completely" complained Cao Zhen, so did the others.</p>
<p>Three retreated backwards quickly until we staggered on the road after rolling down from the car. The watch said 3:30 at that moment. However, it was not
an end, but a new beginning.</p>
