	<h1>Literature comments on "The Cat That Vanished"</h1>
<p>Comments: the article is An except from my High school English textbook 6th</p>
<p>Recently I spent some time in reading English literary. Those ever read
in Chinese now reflect themselves in real appearance. The more time
I feel this way, the more distinctly I know how long a distance I keep
between I could manipulate English language and Chinese language.</p>
<p>Circumstance is not an overwhelming obstacle as long as I pursue beauty
persistently. In those books appear many obscure words which is not
so much helpful in English test. But to cherish them in heart or to
share them with friends, is to fill our lives with beauty.</p>
<p>Fantasy article is full of mystery and confusion. The story is devoid of
ceaseless plots so that I pay more attention to the language itself,
especially the uses of words.</p>
<p>If I kept a cat I would know more about cat behavior. By my six sense
I counted the tabby cat as an actress, good at action movies.
The author uses so many verbs to portray this comical tabby.
There were a manner of vocabulary to express "walk out of some place"
like "creep", "slip", "prowl" and "sneak". They were similar in
meaning so that they can be used as raw materials of synonym alternation.
If you compare them further, you will find that "prowl" is a little special.
It mainly refers to an animal seeking for food or a person tending to commit a crime. The other three all describe quite slow and careful steps. As for "pad"
in this article, I conceive the tabby walked near Will (the name of a boy) spring after spring.
Then she approached Will and and rubbed against his knuckles out of her nature.
Interesting, "rubbing" is a product made out of rubbing. Soon she turned away
to patrol her territory and hunt for food. It seemed that she didn't follow
the original way in which there was no mysterious patch. The patch is not only
a tunnel to another world but the clue of the article. Of course, the cat ceased
there, stretched out her paw (not a hand) to pat something that is modified by
there adverbial phrases. However, we find more concrete descriptions about
the patch in the ninth paragraph. In my view, it makes readers more curious
about the patch but it's not so lively as a chain of actions of main
characters. At the summit of this livelyness, it is the very sentence
describing the accumulation of the strength. I tried to make a sentence similar
to it: "Yang Haodong leapt forward, perfectly close to me, with his eyes blazing, hands claped and hair on end." I knew man behavior -- he is very likely to beat me.</p>
<p>Returning the text, we felt a sense of space because the writer used the
adverbial phrases of places now and then such as "between...and...". Time
and space are eternal topics in literary. They are so common that
we often turn blind eyes to them. We seat ourselves indifferently high above
those mmortal topics expressed by the medium of the extending time and the stretching space partly because of our narrow thoughts and partly owing to
our epicurean tendency. Both the tabby and Will were alone, so are we mainly
in spirit. Will dashed into another world without hesitation to seek for his
guide but where can we discover our true friends? I dare to say they are
the wide world hidden behind the literary worlds. While the tabby touched
the mysterious patch three times before she vanished, how much must we
read before we can transcend our disappointment?</p>
<p>As is often the case, we show less alarm to what we are familiar with.
Reviewing those, however, isn't a process of repeating what we have ever
known, but digging up new meanings. The writer used many figurative words
when she pictured the tabby approaching the patch in total of three times.
As a concluding characterization, "Curiosity overcomes wariness" has a philosophical meaning.</p>
<p>In politics class, we were taught to make the right value of assertion
and choice, but there are moments when we are controlled by surge of sensational
power. "Feeling conquers sanity" happens from time to time.
As Shi Tieshang said, "Man's real name is desire", we can rule over
it though we can't dominate it. Whether we have enough power to dominate feelings by sanity matters a lot. Those who are acknowledged better than others
stick to their tasks even though their head swims. Will seemed to be such a boy,
he made decisions independently --- standing though exhausted, investigating the
spot immediately, scrambling through the hold doubtlessly and turning away to seek tabby regretlessly.</p>
<p>Apart from the picture of characters, the landscape of the strange new world
is also a part of the article. The thick stars and full moon illuminated tall palms nearby, groves of trees afar, hills below and classical temple high. From
the perspective of sniffing, the scent of flowers and the salty smell filled the
hot night --- tranquil, silent, of course, but also terrifying.</p>
<p>The said characters and scenes leave a deep impression on me. As Will fought with himself in though, we are also standing at the threshold of another world.
Now that fire burns and kindness is good(from the article), do you think we
should learn these truth by heart? I mean keeping some vocabularies in memory
as a first step.</p>
