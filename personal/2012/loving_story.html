	<h1>Articles on love</h1>
<p>These two articles were created on my first semester of senior three.</p>
<h2>Where a loving story heading for?</h2>
<p>As the dim light of lampposts shined over the playground of our campus, discords rose from
the hard but gentle earth. I came across him and his lady and ran past them. I heard only the wind singing, not their instant whisper.</p>
<p>One is tall and handsome while the other is genial and beautiful. They were like other partners on the playground. One proficient in science, the other majoring in social science. They have no contradiction with each other Only harmony exists, I perceive.</p>
<p>During a brief break one night, the bell was to ring. I strolled slowly past her seat, where sat her temporary deskmate, that guy. Boys were fighting while girls were learning knowledge by heart, so that few classmates noticed their dating in public. Somehow her kind girl deskmate spoiled her otherwise where would she have been at that moment. Anyway his basketball teammates envied him but they would rather him to decline into desolate valley.</p>
<p>When she look her books from the special place under the computer when the exam finished, and when she leaned her head on the shoulder of him regardless of our pure students, how could this loving story end?</p>
<p>It was just several weeks ago that a pair of former partners of our class was accused by adults.
Maybe it won't be long before another affair ended in tragedy. Not only the two, but the rest of us, because of our standing by, are to blame. I'm reminded of a song called "We are the same" by Zhang Jie, which encouraged us to chase our dream fearlessly, nor to waste time in a fantasy love. You two, my friends, have a rude awaking! Where your romantic story heading for?</p>
<h2>Can love be leaned on?</h2>
<p>Adolescence is full of romantic visualization, especially for the opposite gender. It's virtually
normal to adore whoever has good appearance or is proficient in lessons, of which the former is
more important in most people's views. Nevertheless, it seems abnormal when a boy and a girl forms a close relationship from the mutual attraction before they knew it.</p>
<p>In my class, take an outgoing top student for example. He deals with this kind of thing very well.
He contacts with many girls and treats them equally. In other words, not to concentrate on some refined girl. On the contrary, a few boys always communicate with a fixed one, which has a bad impact on others.</p>
<p>Sometimes judging from the frequency and the exterior phenomenon we may come to a subjective conclusion. What they are talking about matters a lot. A superior student, squeezed dry for lack of nutrition, from time to time flies to the seat near the common girl to help her with her study when there are few students left. It's very kind of him to devote his precious time to that backward girl. By contrast, an invigorating basketball boy tends to hold the innocent lady's hand, wallowing deeply unless stopped.</p>
<p>Some people may contradict that they can continue if the loving doesn't influence their study.
If true, it's just temporary. In the long run, they must tate the sour apple. Loving in high school is no more than a moon in the lake, or a flower in a mirror. Can it last? Can it be leaned on? Maybe it can, on condition that it's just a small part of the whole school life.</p>
