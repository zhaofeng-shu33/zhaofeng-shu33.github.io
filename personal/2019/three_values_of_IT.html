	<h1>Three values of IT</h1>
<p>2019/11/10</p>
<p>Sunny Sunday. Shenzhen is entering the autumn session recently and the weather is a little bit cold.</p>
<p>Youth like us likes to talk about groundtruth and somethings reliable. That's why three persons can informally talk about naratives about labs.  This year the market is seeing AI scientist position is over crowded and some students don't find ideal jobs until now. We also see the teacher position in Shenzhen is very popular overnight, as the local government is investing to increase the quality of K12 education in this city. One of my peers is considering to seek such a teaching position when he graduates. One of my peer is sighing at the rapid change of the IT industry. We are told that everyone is destined to enter the society and experience the social rules. There are many different jobs but the paths are similar. You start from a relatively low position and gradually accumulate your capitals. Academic path or industry path are different but competive characteristics are the same. These two paths are relatively stable. There are also other paths --- NGO and start your own business. NGO is near to freelance jobs and self-owned business is challenging. These two paths are full of undetermined points.   For me initially I consider going to a big local company but now I hesitate for that. Company is focusing on its commercial logic. From a neutral point of view company is not always doing the beneficial things for the community. Academic path seems good but there are also requirements on your achievements. Some balance is to be made between the reality and the ideal work. Initially my lab has a robot project but many 2018 master students have little interest to do it. Now it is nearly abandoned and waiting for new comer to fetch it. This is strange why nobody in our lab is interested in it. One of my peer explained this: it is difficult for our lab to recruit outstanding students in a specific domain. Our school is making students with high ability to achieve the score.  I agree with him partially.   The other part is that we are so easily influenced by the environment. </p>
<p>The typical example comes from the advocation of blockchain by government recently. It indeeds made this area hotter than before. I do not intent to comment on this area but I use this phenomeon to infer the more general problems behind. I encounter a question in humanity asking about what is the purpose of tools? Indeed, we human kinds invent many tools. In my domain, we have many hardware and software available. So what is the purpose of these tools? It should make our life or work easier. And they are not the final pursuit of goals. That is, we are not preserving the activility records in an electronic way to show off something. We are preserving these things for keep a memory of our past. IT technology is rapid changing indeed but past stories are valable in some sense and for some people and organization.</p>
<p>Historically we are preserving valuable things in paper books but nowadays we should make good use of 
IT technology to achieve such goal. Another purpose is for sharing with everyone including myself. Sharing makes different. The third purpose is the service purpose. It is often combined with a very specific domain and serve specific people. It should make the workflow easier than not existing. </p>
<p>I divide the value of IT Technology into these three parts: archiving, sharing and service. Sometimes service can be better if new faster methods are developed. </p>
