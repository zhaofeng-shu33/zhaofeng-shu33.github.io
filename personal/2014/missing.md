# To skeleton spirit

Dear skeleton spirit,

How is your voice and letter?

This is probably the most different letter that I had ever sent to you. It concentrates no more about knowledge and study life, but make documents of my troubled feelings.

With prejudice and complacence came I back to hometown. It seemed I put many things beneath my notice, TV and study-brothers’ college destination, but I can not put down one kind of thing---spiritual love (forgive me using this term ) for someone else. To express it I rely heavily on the unblocked Internet ---If the Internet is of bad state at home, I was very angry and depressed.

But all I have to deal with was merely the former thing, which tortured me more because of no reply from the other side. It was strange for a reasonable modern citizen to fall into such traps, which nearly make him lose interest on all the other things.

Because of this problem, I found my sleeping state was disturbed, which was added a long sleepless prelude and odd dreams; Because of this problem, I found my main study of math and physics was disturbed, which was accompanied with distraction and mechanism; Because of this problem, I found my eating was disturbed, at which time my mind was trying to think of method to make contact with you; Because of this problem, I found my climbing experience was a little disturbed, at which time I can not speak very freely.

But what I’d like to say if I can contact you or meet you? Maybe about your English classes and your attitude about English literature; Maybe to hand a gift which I bought with virtual shells at English camp store and an English novel which I was rewarded in one English class to you; Maybe…

At present I conceive a lot while it is a little. I can not forget my English teacher of Junior three but her words of “Doing myself in realistic life” makes me backward three inches. As I can remember, I happened to be in a false lecture about how to learn English, given by a simultaneous interpreting expert. But the lecture proved to be an encouragement lecture, spoken in Chinese. In my present view, encouragement was of little use, which reflected merely the worldly value points of success. It was neither Confucian nor Marxism. But at this point I want to repeat his mentioning of one girl.

The excellent expert said, “When I met this new colleague and heard her perfect work, I was impressed and thought she must come out of either foreign language university of Beijing or Shanghai. But afterwards I acknowledged her background, which surprised me. She was not majoring in English in her under-graduate education and came out of a second-level college! But how can she be so successful?...(He talked about the importance of resume, which I thought lower of.)”

( As I can remember, she was probably majoring in law.) “She began to make her English note in major class. If she felt the class was boring, she translate the (law) textbook in English to kill time. This quick link between translation is of vital importance in simultaneous interpreting, you know…”

What the expert said I felt no such strength at that time, maybe you would think it was too hard to only write in English in your notebook. But what makes difference is her later transformation…

Before I told the heard story, I intended to sign, maybe you will follow your given path to become a middle-school English teacher, just like my respected junior 3 English teacher. After I told the heard story, I felt that maybe I had no qualification to become a virtual educator. Since presently I disliked those peers who spread their so-called success to young study brothers and sisters. Even success people make a lot of mistakes, let alone I.

Maybe all what I said was merely to hide my emerged feelings toward you. What is the influence of the use of English to write to you or even almost anyone? Maybe it is to make the writing contains less water. If I had chance to talk about another part of my language exertion, I would send you another email. To add one sentence which I was concerned in reality, can your state of phone turning-off be turned on?

Sincerely,

Troubled Free wind
