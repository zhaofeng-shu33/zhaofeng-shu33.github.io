	<h1>Keep something about my English study this semester</h1>
<p>2014/5/25</p>
<p>What has happened came beyond one’s comprehension. I know little about English courses in Normal University. But there are some problems I know during my life for non-major students learning English.</p>
<p>Academic English is put at such an important state than general English that there are few no courses for general English in Tsinghua University. Some Chinese teachers will provide some training for attenders under the title of academic English. But it often helps a little because of lack practice after class. One English class only has 90 minutes a week and its teaching contents under the direction of the superior should be how to write a literature review, argumentative essay or how to debate (these are the three courses I attend as formal students or auditor). However, the teacher actually differs a lot. Some teachers talk too much about the unusual aspects of Chinese society.</p>
<p>For students, because of the embarrassing position of English learning (a teacher often outlines, “if you do not practice it for a month, there is little change in your ability of English, always at that middle level.) the active learning progress of English is much ignored by most students including I. Of course a few excellent non-major students are of minority who master in English, maybe the average English level of Tsinghua University is no better than English major students in Normal University.</p>
<p>There is one point to be stressed. Over six year middle school training in English is enough for basic and everyday use of English. In one sense (I think),  training at general background is less meaningless than self-training in major background. For example, English edition of math textbooks are as an option of reference book which piles up in the library. Another use of English for me is extensive for information acquirement. Marx’ original work, thesis about early Qing and Chinese contemporary literature development, these all rely on Google and Wikipedia. One most essential use is about western literature. Some famous works are translated in Chinese. If I find great difficulty in catching the literal meaning of the texts (for example, extracts from "The Divine Comedy" and "The Tragedy of Macbeth"), I have to turn to translator's help. But Chinese translators can never be so diligent as to translate all literary work in Chinese. For example, I cannot find any clue about one of Gogol’s works--- "the Overcoat". Maybe it was because this short story is in a collection of Gogol’s works and the common name of it can not work when you put it on Baidu. Another reason maybe the stress of western literature is different from the “Chinese preference”. As for Russia literature, Maxim Gorky is not even mentioned in our courses. Or we can say western socialist literature is totally excluded from the courses which the modernist literature including Expressionism, Stream of Consciousness and Existentialism, which are taught in continuous three weeks.</p>
<p>I can never forget about my reading of Virginia Woolf’s An Unwritten novel. As I can remember, there is a short story called "The Mark on the Wall", which is also written by her and selected into our Senior Chinese reading textbooks. These two short stories happen to be in one collection of her --- Monday and Tuesday. Maybe she wants to write her consciousness from common life. But there are no differences for me reading either work using the technique of Stream of Consciousness. I spend tens of hours previewing the sect of Stream of Consciousness, including important writers as James Joyce, William Faulkner, and T.S. Eliot.</p>
<p>I have to say most of my courses, especially English courses push me to learn. Beyond the contents of them, I do nothing. One weaken point is about relatively poor oral understanding. Although there is great improvement compared to eight months ago, faster speed is always makes me confused. But I do not think any necessary methods taken to improve it, extra listening is often a form rather than a concrete material.</p>
