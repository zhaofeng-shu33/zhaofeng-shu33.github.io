	<h1>Pursuing Dream</h1>
<p>2014/9/3</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>This essay tells the story of one of my classmates at Senior 1 and 2. She is called Snow Darling (张雪）. At Senior 1 we do not split the subjects. At Senior 2, my classmates are a mix of humanity students and science students. Humanity students do not need to have Physics class while science students do not need to have Politics Class.</p>
<h2>Narrative of Snow Darling</h2>
<h2>(1)</h2>
<p>In one forgotten exam praise and summary assembly of Senior Three, a plain girl (Bright Pretty, 张灵莉) from Class Six, as a representative of Senior Three Girls, stepped onto the front stage claiming that everyone is a heroine as long as she dreams big enough.</p>
<p>This situation suddenly reminded me of a girl, with whom I was first acquainted two years ago. It happened after we had the first month exam and she was left far behind. She reflected herself on her summary report, “You are far lagging behind not because of your being dummy or of weak knowledge basis, but of the fact that you haven’t spread all your efforts into study. Playful mind leads to nothing but failure, thus sharply hurting your parents’ hearts… I really do not waste my time… and I dream keenly on going to Chinese University of Geosciences."</p>
<p>Who is she mentioned above? Actually I knew little about her expect her exam summary report which I peeped as I collected them as a small group leader. Later everyone in class was familiar with her as our geography class representative.</p>
<p>“Please Hand in geography homework!” exclaimed she after class. And the so-called homework was “finishing page 3-33 of geology help-study reference book.”</p>
<p>“Give me a share to copy, please, Reverend Geography Representative Lady.” Begged one short guy, Forest （贺森森）.</p>
<p>“No way, I must bring all of them to the office of geography teacher. You can copy the standard answer instead!”</p>
<p>“But... you know, the answer has too many Chinese characters and also inconvenient to copy since it was attached as appendix of the reference book”</p>
<p>“I have no obligations to help you in such a matter. But I have to warn you in advance." Snow Darling annoyedly pointed her finger to Forest: "if you do not hand in the homework, I will mark your name and the geography teacher will find you himself!” Hardly had she finished her sentence, she stepped away from Forest’s desk with a pile of reference book in hand. “Wait a minute, my merciful Representative!”</p>
<p>“Blame on you since you haven’t finished …” Snow Darling’s laughter vanished gradually as she stepped out of the classroom and ran along the corridor to the office of geography teacher.</p>
<p>It seemed that such common trivial often happens at each short break time. Students like Forest made full use of class break time --- do not misunderstand me --- they were mostly making up the homework, which was claimed forgotten to finish.</p>
<p>However, things reversed after a period of time when Forest was happy to exercise his rights as the Chinese representative.</p>
<p>So in one normal break time, he shouted, “Hand in Chinese ‘Big Notes’ immediately!”.
When he passed by the seat of Snow Darling, she was rummaging hastily for her ‘Big Notes’ in her desk hole.</p>
<p>“I have little patience, you know.” Forest smiled slyly at Snow Darling.</p>
<p>“But I saw my note this morning if my memory didn’t cheat me. Anyway, you can perform your obligations without waiting for me. I will personally hand in my Chinese homework.”
“But you know what our Chinese teacher (马莉）is, a female tiger, who required that late handed homework was equal to unfinished. I can cover your special situation out of kind heart. But next time you are supposed to give me a vent at geography homework. As classmates it was very natural to help mutually.”</p>
<p>“How can you say such derelict sentence! ...” At the same time Big Notes of Snow Darling was thrown from back row and hit directly on Forest. A voice followed the attack: “My fault, I lend your Big Notes without permission…” Forest was steaming as he was neglected by the offender, but was reminded by Snow Darling that he had little time to carry piles of Big Notes to the Chinese Office before the next class began.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>When such anecdote didn’t occur during break, it was most probably before the Chinese class.</p>
<p>Once a time Forest in a hurry wrote on the blackboard, “On <em>An Exhortation to Learning</em>（荀子-劝学篇）,there will be a selective reciting check among us!” “Take every second to go over the text!” He appealed to us.</p>
<p>Snow Darling was hurrying copying the math homework when the ominous message was heard. Hardly had she rummaged out of the class hole the Chinese Compulsory One when our stern Chinese teacher came into the classroom. The reading sounds immediately became louder and pervaded within every corner of our classroom. Hardly had Snow Darling found out the “An Exhortation of Learning” when the bell knelled. Perspiration exuded from every corner of Snow Darling I dare say when the column of her seat was suffering the selective reciting check. The outcome was obvious and a lost spirit was left behind after both failure of Chinese reciting requirement and math homework copy.</p>
<p>Afterwards, she wrote on her notebook the following sentences and I peeped it out of some reason which I forgot now.</p>
<p>“Damn that you are relaxing yourself recently! Really relax, doesn’t you? Look at the effects! Just as put a pole under the sun and the shadow emerges immediately! Your time schedule is bad enough and you waste your precious time up to 4,5 hours every day. You go as far as to wander your mind in self-studying time. You are to die if not to behave well!!!”</p>
<h2>(2)</h2>
<p>Choice between Humanity and Science is made by every student of Senior One at No. 1 Middle School. But before that, some unexpected sequel happened. We were suddenly told by the head teacher that Snow Darling determined to drop out of school!</p>
<p>A discuss about her was launched in one class meeting by Middle Winning (孙中凯）, a No.2 top student. He said reputedly: “I despised her”. This was his conclusion but his analysis was not kept because of my incomplete diary:</p>
<p>"I often heard some fresh student feignedly complained about his or her too many classes at college. But why Senior One, especially latter part of it was more torturing even if it provided us with only nine subjects?"</p>
<p>Forest was following those girls hurrying to the dormitory buildings of girls on the morning when it was said Snow Darling was determined to go home. He came back first and disturbed the uneasy air of morning reading in Class Five.</p>
<p>“Hey, Forest, why did you come there? — Maybe you are stealthily fond of...” Auspicious Dragon （胡福龙） ridiculed Forest.</p>
<p>“Nonsense! As her classmate and as a member of class commission, it was natural! Do you understand?”</p>
<p>“It was natural to step into dormitory of girls?”</p>
<p>“Actually I haven’t because of too many girls crowded the narrow room. Oh, how pity!”</p>
<p>The reading sounds decreased gradually as girls thronged into our classroom.</p>
<p>Discussions were again carried out around Snow Darling until our head teacher entered with frowned brow. “It was of little use though I urged her many times. The Geography Teacher tried also without gain.”</p>
<p>Forest buried his head with two elbows and shrugged his shoulders periodically, when Snow Darling’s information was given by the head teacher. Thoughts raced through my mind at that time:</p>
<p>“I sympathize with her. I think she must have huge difficulties. But now the position is empty and tea is cold. Classmates including me will soon forget her and move forward without her...”</p>
<p>Family conditions are one of critical factors that force Snow Darling to make final decisions. Afterwards I knew a little about it from her. But that was soon submerged into my tense contest of study with others.</p>
<p>Summer season is after all the unfeeling time for classmates to drop. Several days later, Snow Darling’s quit became short rest at home and she came back quietly.</p>
<p>Time flies and our Senior Two --- a poetic season maybe, came. Snow Darling wrote many imaginative and splendid essays, notably among members of “The Broad Elegant” （博雅社）literary association. Fortunately I still preserve one original complete essay written by her. I also wrote down a poem about her, which can be translated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A hundred Doors were locked, in which an ideal lived. Outside the snow accumulates a thousand meters high;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a lofty delicate apartment stayed the terrified girl who prowled to and fro with shining tears on her fragile face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will someone show mercy to the attainment evinced by paying tribute to willow leaf?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will anyone express sympathy towards the jade girdle hung on pine and golden bracelet buried in snow?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looking farther to the Sky Mountain until the remote countryside was before her eyes; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dreaming back to the Roof of the World until the high celestial blessings were in her arms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Though placed in the severe winter the plum blossoms still keep the chastity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly Snow Darling can persist until the spring comes. Really can she?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At Senior Two, once I passed by another humanity male student of class 5, Hope Ground （刘希坤）, “Have a look, your political book is too tidy.”</p>
<p>“Actually I tended to have a nap at such classes.”</p>
<p>“How about other humanity students in our class?” I quested.</p>
<p>“Guys are like me, and girls are like Snow Darling, who always fill her textbooks with sentences from teachers and reference books.”</p>
<p>“But are you glad to fall behind girls?”</p>
<p>At this time, Forest returned with Chinese Big Note from Chinese office, and replied instead of Hope Ground, “Of course I am.”</p>
<p>Perhaps what Hope Ground described was not out of ground. One evening during the self-studying time their geography teacher came into our classroom. He spoke to Snow Darling and let her assign homework to the humanity students in our class. Hardly the teacher came out of the room when Snow Darling hurried after him, chanting “Teacher, Teacher. Please wait a moment...” with the geography reference book in one hand, a pencil in another hand and unsolved question in mind.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, twenty minutes later, our head teacher with unpleasant mood raided our classroom. “Snow Darling!” He shouted. “Why are you sneering so frivolously?” Snow Darling denied the accusation at first. But the outcome became more unfavorable for her behavior --- She was severely criticized for damaging the morals of self-study time and punished to stand until the school was dismissed.</p>
<p>I tried to encourage her by a paper slip. After the event, she wrote to me: 
“I was indeed to blame for this matter...”</p>
<p>Criticized though she was, her morning hard work was continuing. I was not an early type coming to school, but every time I stepped into our classroom, only female reading sounds can be heard. Either English words or repeated ancient Chinese texts echoed in the room. Snow Darling was always one of them, who was sometimes too hurry to forget combing her long straight locks, or sometimes standing up while reading to go against the tiredness.</p>
<p>In her essay I kept, she quoted many encouraged sentences. One of them goes like:
“Sky is high; Tiptoe to the shine; Heart has wings; owning Courage to fly; Dream not unreachable; Happiness will stand by!”</p>
<p>In one unforgettable exam praise and summary assembly of Senior Three, a plain girl Bright Pretty from Class Six stepped onto the front stage claiming that: "everyone is a heroine as long as she dreams big enough!”. She is not Snow Darling. But is she really not Snow Darling?</p>
