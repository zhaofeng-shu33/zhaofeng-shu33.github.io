# From the value sense
2014/11/9

Dear Denny:

Sorry for not continuing writing after your short reply last weekend. Time Limitation is a small problem compared with my contradiction between different value senses within my heart. I wanted to use this chance as a valve to release my inner struggle, which is probably nothing to others. It is possibly inevitable to stay up late and affect my morning reading seriously next day. Anyway, I started from the shocking lecture given at the fifth course this Thursday.

I once thought it was more difficult to find the truth in the history near to us, let alone the fast-changing contemporary times. The methodology I deduced from such idea is to neglect them and keep silent to these issues. Maybe that is one of the reason I quitted Seeking Truth Association, after I fully realized they got too near to our contemporary society. To tell the truth, I seemed to be greatly influenced by 钱忠书，whose courtesy name is 默存，(I will talked about this idol of mine later). It is easier to imagine his methodology to “survive” at new China and passed away peacefully while many other writers were criticized heavily.)

However, after the new semester, I was surprised to find my fundamental change at this fundamental problem. The trigger is difficult to identify. At least writing style of Mencius and Marx or Engels had great influence on me. Especially I read The Manifest of Communist every morning a few weeks before. At least what the courses of basic principle of Marxism and of the ancient Europe history poured out made me very dissatisfied. According to the critical judgment of our English Reading teacher (Miss Sun), political advocators are killers to university education. Unluckily, I had found the two professors mentioned above expressed their statuses and thus became killers to our education. The first openly exhibition of my dissatisfaction happened almost three weeks ago. After class, I talked to the professor of Ancient Europe History. “I find your course is a little boring. You teach the Greek History according to dialectical materialism, which contradicted with my historical view tendency. I imagined, whether we could start from the mythology of Greek, or the philosophy, or what those people thought about their world, and constructed and restored that historical period.” Yesterday, Miss Sun said, “Ideology is the killer to humanity research, since it merely uses the materials to prove the righteousness of that ideology.” I think now this description can be given to this professor. I was about to leave when I heard his answer (which probably made me make final decision not to come back here until the final exam) to another students’ request, “can you put the ppt on the weblearning?” He said, “you see, I only put many pictures on my ppt. So the essences are not on it. What you should learn, I think, is to learn how to take notes efficiently. I think this is really important, especially when you attend meetings in the future and hear the speech given by leaders.” Actually, I think his teaching is quite like the speech of some leader. When he gave an analysis to a historical event, he organized in a dogmatic way with the help of draft sheets.

I was really sorry to make such attack on a certain individual probably based on my multi-ideology. But hadn’t Mencius and Marx done so? (Below I tried to directly quote the  theory, you can omit this subpart) When Mencius was debating with 告子 (about 人性论)，He openly blamed heavily on his opponent only after his first sentence: 率天下之人而祸仁义者，必子之言夫. Marx criticized others more literally and satirically. Marx deduced the antagonism existing in historical view of Proudhon ( transliterated as 蒲鲁东， classified as bourgeois thinker in the theoretical system of Marx) and said he, as “a clever fellow, is able by his cunning to discover the hidden thought of God, the unity of two isolated thoughts---which are only isolated because Mr. Proudhon has isolated them from practical life, from present-day production, that is, from the union of realities which they express.”

Simply speaking, Marx was for historical materialism (synonym of dialectic materialism), while his opponent was idealist. Restricting myself in the historical language environment and as a outsider, I tried to think it was not a problem for me to divert greatly from the historical materialism of Marx. However, in some cases, I agreed with this historical theory and applied it. For example, in the same letter in which Marx criticized Mr. Proudhon, he had the following arguments.

Indeed, he does what all good bourgeois do. They all tell you that in principle, __are the only basis of life, but that in practice they leave much to be desired. They all want ___ without its tragic effects. They all want the impossible, namely the conditions of bourgeois existence without the necessary consequences of those conditions.  None of them understands that the bourgeois form of production is historic and transitory, just as the feudal form was. This mistake arises from the fact that the bourgeois man is to them the only possible basis of every society; they cannot imagine a society in which men have ceased to be bourgeois.

I omitted some contents in two places because Marx talked about the characteristics of capitalist society, which I think is not universal to various social development stages. What I intend to do is merely to substitute bourgeois which appeared in the above passage for the corresponding group in our Chinese society.

I would not make further argument along the idea of Marx, partly because of my relative ignorance of the comprehensive and aggressive theory and partly because of my hesitation at such application of Marxism.  Is it absurd to attack an organization based on imperial Marxism (title given by 求是学会) according to your own interpretation of Marxism? Although Seeking Truth Association had done so and formed their unique interpretations, they actually had developed for twenty years, fluctuated, had unsuccessful theoretical try and most powerfully social practice deeply into workers and farmers. I think maybe the role of the latter item is just similar to the function of experiments for natural science. I had nothing, only a scanty and rough reading besides.

I wondered, without the stimulation of Miss Sun, whether I would become so radical today. Focusing on your academic research is enough, isn’t it? Anyway, I took out “The Concise Mathematical History”, which I had put away for at least two weeks. Cauchy, a legitimist and a royalist, is a great mathematician too radical to be deprived of his position during revolutionary period. The supplement material of Wikipedia told me that “these events marked a turning point in Cauchy’s life, and a break in his mathematical productivity.” How terrible for a mathematician to be forced to leave his working place! But Cauchy’s fate was not the worst, another less prominent mathematician was put into prison in Russia probably due to his overwhelmed enthusiasm to Napoleon’s military action.

At this point, I will neither answer too hastily nor subjectively avoid this fundamental problem. At least, I have to pay the prices for my already taken measures towards this problem. Anyway, now I’d like to make a proper transition from this problem to another.

I appreciated my mathematical analysis professor Z for his inspirations in class and even after class. He once made a comment on our APEC vacation: I suggest you not play around all the world and concentrate your attention. I always wonder why our students are so busy every day. Something like voluntary works, P.E. compulsories…

L (a young lady in our class): Plus Basic Principle Course.

Z: Actually, we have enough causes to be busy. But we are busy too separately. We move quickly from one place to the other and time is wasted on our preparation to get into academic state. While at universities aboard…

L: I heard C (a student in my class who was admitted into Cambridge to finish his undergraduate study) said they only had three courses this semester. And they had not the other “colorful” courses. Besides, they have an opportunity to be face to face with their instructors twice a week…

What this conversation accorded perfectly with Miss Sun said this Thursday. Domestic Education Investment maybe is a problem. But this is not my key point.

Honestly speaking, I was typically becoming what Professor Z described, especially this semester. During weekdays, I went quickly from one place to the other. I found every time I almost converted myself into German language state, I had to finish other things immediately because I can never spare the whole time unit (for example, a whole afternoon) to learn my second foreign language, which had little relation with my first major or second major.

Although I devote as much as I can to first major courses including physics, especially at weekends, the time allocation is still not enough, which implied at my familiar extents to what we’ve learned.

You may think what the several paragraphs above are nothing but complaint and exaggeration, and its by-product is to show off myself. Maybe it’s true, but starting from my idea I want to make further explanation.

Ethnicity and morality can be suspected based on my first part of this email, but I still respect one of our tradition a lot, 贯通中西，纵横古今，渗透文理。The third tradition of our university is mentioned already by Miss Sun this Thursday. It is natural to think it is easier for a science student to achieve the third realm (which is easier than the first two, since we have the “colorful” courses). However, even if we admit the reasonability of the three realms at the time of Republic of China, how can we still stick to it since the fundamental changes which had happened around the globe? Only computer science and biotechnology had made all the classics become fossils in many peoples’ eyes. I don’t know much of the current logic about this fundamental problem—how far we should go at 通识教育? Based on my ideals of six regions it is not a problem for me but it is a problem in reality, showing itself every minute in my time distribution. I can only read a little about Greek History or Marxism instead of attending lectures. I can only scan a little of the extracurricular mathematical books with parts of my homework undone. And should I devote myself every week to write summary like this? Anyway, It is hard to immediately change my mode now.

At least I had pretty strong feelings towards my major based on my newly-forming natural science philosophy. The mechanical teaching mode made me also consider the possibility of skipping the class. The only international accepted theorem named after China (中国剩余定理) made me have transitory passion to write an article based on my historical sense. But to tell the truth, I have to submit to the fact the first and the third part (I will talk about below) occupy parts of my passions and thoughts.

I mentioned 钱忠书 before, who I’d like to use as a transition to my attitude to language and literature, on which we can know more life itself, I think.

The topic for our English Listening Course is Happiness, whose sources (TED speeches) are inevitable shallow in contents (although it has difficulty for my English listening level). Only in class a thought struck me suddenly---忠书 once wrote an article titled 《论快乐》， which was selected in my high school Chinese reading book. I have to admit it is too deep for me to understand even now. But I cannot hold my curiosity and scanned it very quickly just now. By doing so was I reminded of my initial motion (probably I never forgot it), which gradually formed without theoretical ideological influence. I think. I admired 忠书，although I read only a little of his works. Probably he was the best to achieve the first two realms of the three mentioned above, although in his major--- language and literature. You can blame his 掉书袋 habits in writing. Almost all the analogies made in 《论快乐》 are those I’d never heard of. But what made difference was not piles of analogies, but his synthetics to get his own idea, which was hard to parallel.

The distinguishing between popular culture and classical culture may annoy you. But I think it is another fundamental problem.

It seems our language learning environment is so different because of the extensive application of high-tech devices. But it also seems to have problems. So I heard the following dialog.

It happened between my German language professor and another student, who consulted the professor about how to improve his listening ability.

S: Recently I tried to listen to German language news.

P: That is probably too difficult. Through which kind of channels do you get the news?

(I didn’t quietly get his words, but one point is sure, it is specially provided for learners.)

Then the student played the news on his ipad.

P: This is news read in German language by Chinese. You’d better find videos of native speakers to practice your listening or speaking.

S: But it is harder to get the proper.

P: Actually Logo News is proper but it doesn’t contain any subtitles. I remember years ago it had subtitles.

S: I found some services online, but it is not free of charge.

P: At such cases (finding good resources online) I think you are far more familiar than me. Finding proper videos (for example movies) with two language subtitles is the best…

Perhaps some students once or still had these intentions: looking at a few foreign language movies and imitate their speaking can improve their language skills greatly. This attitude is criticized by Miss Sun this Thursday. Of the best, this methodology is targeting at communication. Of the worst, I don’t know how to say. Maybe frivolous or superficial are selectable adjectives. After my concentrating listening to our coursework had I gradually realized (not the verb, grasp) the rules of improving language ability. Maybe just like the rules of learning how to use a complex tool well, it had little philosophical basis although you may be happy to experience this process because you know you can do much meaningful work after you can use this tool skillfully.

Yours
