# sketch of my ideas on July 22nd
2014/7/22

Geting home meaning being cutting off the Internet. Maybe you can check your Email adress using your smart phone.

But honestly to say, I can not get rid of odd ideas.

If there are some maginize or social-paper put at the entrance of the library, I often take a piece of several kinds away.

While eating at canteen, I look through which interest me, as figures like ethnologist 民族學家 潘光旦. Probably I am his type. THe point of his life interest me most is his enthusiasm towards biology especially evolutionism. I more and more feel the figures during the early period of 20th century of China gave me many reference in behaving myself. Among them, I appreciate more and more on 錢忠書. To make things more ridiculous, I mentioned countless times of 華羅庚 during the period of English summer camp. This is because I use him as an example in my speech to demonstrate the benefits of learning foreigh language towards mathematical research. Actually, I knew little about research and 華, only his disablity and his genius. The key point lies that experience of others has little to do with one's realistic life. I can not change my life routine a lot since I plan it a month before. But as the routine goes, especially as I lonely study mathematics at Old Library, somehow I can not resist expression of feelings. .....

Time is going into midnight, I have hardly started my main point. Do you have any tendecy towards Confucian? I plan to visit the hometown of Confucius. If you tend to 儒家 and have never been there, maybe we can go there together(perhaps with someone else) this summer vocation. Even if you prefer to stay at home, we can also talk about Confucian if you had some interest.

Looking forward to your sharing your plan and story.
