	<h1>Three senior three classmates</h1>
<p>2014/8/11</p>
<p>Dear skeleton spirit</p>
<p>I hate to be forced to do something, but today I can not avoid it. My cousin was poor in English while I had to give some instructions to help him improve his English scores at CEE. Tonight I looked through quickly my past diary and found the figure whose English level probably was similar to this classmate---Zhang Yuhan. But his name is trivial and I had no intention to comment on others. But the story about him which I had noted was centered.</p>
<p>It happened when we were having English class just after the new semester of Senior Three.</p>
<p>Big Height(Zhang’s nickname) wandered and covered his distraction by drinking water from his bottle. How can he escape the bright eyes of our English teacher? “Big Height, what were you doing just now!” But Big Height was quick in mind, and retorted, ”Ms Web, I studied English so hard that I was so thirsty. So…” “All right, now you are to make a sentence using what I have just taught.” No doubt that Big Height was in trouble. I think he was too nervous to repeat in Chinese the sentence which Ms Web gave him. Definitely he was not allowed to sit down because of his bad behavior. Then the Old Orange (Cheng Weizheng) was called. Old Orange was no better than Big Height in answering. To explain my judgment, I’ll give the dialog fully as follows:</p>
<p>Old Orange: Ms Web, I’m thinking too hard to utter the answer.</p>
<p>Ms Web: But can you repeat my question?</p>
<p>Old: I failed to do this either, Madam.</p>
<p>Ms(angrily): As I often say, you might not get the blame if you are unable to answer rightly. But you are to blame if you cannot repeat my question.</p>
<p>Old(murmured): Repeating question is of no creativity.</p>
<p>Ms: What did you say? </p>
<p>Old: Madam, I merely said repeating Big Height’s question is of no creativity. If you asked me another question, I assured you to answer it both quickly and rightly.</p>
<p>After 10 hours when it was night self-studying time, Ms Web called Old Orange again publicly. “Watch carefully how many mistakes you made on the simple test of knowledge points of Module One! I have nothing to give you but a title of "Fly on the water". Watch also carefully how well Big Height made!” Two piece of paper was thrown to one direction.
I found the story was scattered on the diary and I made up some plots to link it. But it was still not interesting enough probably because of the special air of Senior Three. I signed to continue type the first appearance of Mr. Yellow or Executive Huang. (adapted from my diary)</p>
<p>As a stout guy with spectacles, he strode into our classroom to give a short lecture about how to go to a good college. “In order to achieve your dream college, you must develop a habit of not letting your body waste go as long period of time as possible. Only by doing so can you adapt you well on the exam spot...”</p>
<p>Soon I found myself documenting too many feelings in the English diary, many of which lost its meaning after CEE. But the contradiction they reflected was more or less rooted in mind of other students. But here I missed them.</p>
<p>I put down one notebook and referred to another. The start of it was document of choosing of universities before "Independent Recruitment" of college. I was amused to read these details because of their trivial importance after the ending.</p>
<p>I also found I made notes of many sentences of Mr. Yellow, a gross teacher, who said in class, "I am not content with your grades as well as your attitude. You are destined to fail unless you follow my instructions. Get a clip to nip all your basic knowledge paper. Write key knowledge points down on your paper since your hand is idle."</p>
<p>After he left class, our monitor intimated his voice,“Although Executive Zhang has stressed many times not to speak out of topic, I still want to give you a warning…” </p>
