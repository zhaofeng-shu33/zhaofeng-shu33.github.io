	<h1>To Denny</h1>
<p>2014/10/19</p>
<p>Dear Denny:</p>
<p>Glad to receive your short reply so that I can continue this email.  Maybe I can use a term  “empiricism” to summarize your description. I know it is never accurate, since your humor and liveliness contradicted with any archaic theory, which impressed me a lot.</p>
<p>This time, I tried to arrange the structure differently and abandoned my theory-based writing style. Since you express your world view generally, you’d better omit the third Chinese essay of this email, which will share the analogous tone with all my preceding email.</p>
<p>But around the first two Chinese essays of this email, you will find they are not well organized and showed my past and incompetence in some degree. </p>
<p>Actually, I carefully saved my past compositions and emails or letters from my peers. Firstly, I’d like to share one key summary of my senior high school with you, from which some characters still survive to my present stage. </p>
<p>2013 8 11 两类考试总结——阳光与阴霾同在的高中</p>
<p>Some basic information about me should be added for fear that you misunderstand this kind of composition. Hope you do not think I am talking nonsense below.</p>
<p>Coming from a small town of 山东 province, I didn’t know clearly how I get a pretty high score at 华约 written examination of physics, while my mathematics score is very common. It seemed I experienced a very free summer vacation last year but I suddenly found I also did nothing meaningful in my present point of view. One shatter still came from problematic high school education system. Now I’m very confused why I would listen to the physics competition lecture given by my previous physics teacher, who taught new Senior-Three in that summer vacation. Such stupid affairs take almost all of my time. Even though I tried to read more Chinese books that summer vacation, I did badly since I did purposelessly. And only recently did I realize the falseness of the statement, “Reading a new book is always beneficial”. Do you agree with this statement?</p>
<p>I changed slowly in my first semester at THU, which is fully exhibited by the following electric diary:</p>
<p>2013 12 12 从机房出来的无热情引起的回顾</p>
<p>Another remark should be supplemented is that I am loyal and devoted to Red Education at that time.  Since I lived so narrowly in the past three years, I naturally hold the military and political education last September as absolute truth at that time. The first time the 党建辅导员 argued us to join the party, I actively replied her by a sincere application form and took corresponding course called 党课. When I suddenly found my unfamiliarity with 党章 at the exam, I felt a little guilty. 
Fundamental change happened during my second semester and this summer vacation, which is the indirect result of courses I take and associations I join into.</p>
<p>A typical writing goes like follows:</p>
<p>2014 6 12  简谈如风的心理武器</p>
<p>Actually there seemed no fundamental change from this key summary to my present stage. You should understand the above email as a kind of exaggeration of myself, but you still can see the deep imprint of some theory on me.</p>
<p>I hesitate to write the following paragraph. Since I had already exhibited their contents in all my last emails to you, it matters nothing to show my core element.</p>
<p>My new ideal criterion is reestablished about four months ago, which may seem absurd to others and even to myself. It goes like this: 文史数外 (random sequence of the four subjects)，plus two theories (Marxism and Confucianism).</p>
<p>It is natural to start from subjects to construct one’s destination but now I organize them as three different world views and their applications. The most principal one for me is absolutely The Foundation of Western Natural Science, while I can only use free time to learn a little about the other two systems of theories. Interestingly, I always hold that western scientists have their independent natural philosophy theory but what I read tonight changed a little of my knowledge. In a letter Euler (the most influential mathematician in history) explored the most perfect world and evilness of human based on natural science. Because of the intricate structure of living creature and harmonious movement law, our world must be created by a Creator, who endowed with the newly-born spirits goodness. But as spirit has its relative liberty or freedom, it has the tendency to do evil things. What I like to make comment lies at the interesting phenomenon. As time went on, Christianity absorbed the products of natural science and became more powerful. I do not reject Christianity and am open-minded to learn about it (maybe a course called 圣经文学选读 is a good chance), since it is unalienable from western literature. At the same time, Marxism, at its day of birth, based its theory on products of natural science. It seems natural science is only a tool, which can be used by quite different theory. Now I just postpone my personal answer to this problem, since my reading recently is too limited.</p>
<p>How can I manage them and make progress? I do not know. So I chose to preview all my major courses and physics in this summer vacation, during this process I was so inefficient to make me doubt myself and ideal. Recently I use the system awareness to cover my shortcoming at the level of so-called science IQ. In my potential awareness, I always feel the high danger to cover the six subjects simultaneously in this semester for the first time.</p>
<p>I use one anecdote as the ending of this email, which showed my another small change.</p>
<p>This Thursday after English Reading I, I went to take 习题课. The teaching assistant  merely converts what he had wrote on paper to the blackboard. It is quite natural to fall back after his pace. But sometimes he will introduce new concepts and omit explanation. At one point, I just interrupted him and required the definition of a concept I didn’t know. The assistant wrote a set on the blackboard without a word. I was more confused. So I interrupted him again. It is quite amusing and some students could not help laughing. The most unexplainable point is that I did not feel embarrassed. At that time I believed I was never the only person on the spot who was ignorant of this concept. Since I live in a competitive environment, I must position myself in my department. I think young male adults are mainly divided into two groups, one of which only fulfill what major courses require, which I can do better than them even though their IQs are higher. Students from another group always belong to far-away study models, since their IQs and sweats combine well. I don’t need to suffer myself to catch them as the first semester I tried to. Did my confidence at that embarrassing occasion come from my “investment” and “payback” at other subjects?  Anyway, the story did not end.  The assistant answered another question instead. So I answered more politely and directly the third time. My insistence lies at my consideration of the extension of a concept. If I look at reference book instead of asking others, I may find a too general definition which I can not understand. I think it was worthwhile to do so with the special gifts of two bursts of laughter.</p>
<p>Yours</p>
<p>May you live happily and meaningfully</p>
<p>Free wind</p>
