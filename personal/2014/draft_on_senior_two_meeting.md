# my English draft on Senior Two mobilization meeting
2014/8/9

Dear Skeleton spirit,

When I can not hold myself, I suddenly find what I treasure most in my high school, those writings which are by hands. Maybe putting them on screen is a blasphemy, but I have to find a way to release myself.

One vital part of those writings is in English. I can still remember the hard steps at that time when I finished every English sentence on my “diary”. This time I am going to iterate a speech draft, which was attributed to my English-first speech draft at the end of Senior Two.

There was only sixteen days before the final exam when I was asked to give a speech on the assembly meeting for mobilization of final exams. You have to figure out the lack of devices at that time. A written Chinese-English dictionary is not efficient for use, while I have ipad to look up words at present. After I wrote down the English draft. I translated it into Chinese and read it on the meeting. This is a draft which contains the sayings of my teachers, which the quotation of my physics teacher made audiences laugh a lot.

But what is the realistic meaning of iterating the draft? Is there any similarity between the final exam of Senior School and college exam weeks? The ideas reflected from the draft is somehow pure and can never be found by myself now. For example, to demonstrate that “We have to make good use of limited time,” I asked a series of questions:

Do you sleep soundly while others are occupied with morning reading?

Do you hurry to leave the classroom, leaving unsolved problems after class, while others are still burying their heads?

Do you tend to waste precious time in talking about useless topics with your intimate friends while others are discussing physics problems?

The tone throughout the whole draft is very intense so that some jokes (only exist in English writings) are just cold jokes. For example, I stress that we should not throw humanity subjects totally away ( to science students) and then I wrote,” In regard to those subjects which is essential to our prospects, we can never fish for three days and then rest for two days.
The reason why I chose “ Make diligence a character” was explained at the last two paragraphs of the draft, which I want to quote totally to show my purity at that time,”

Our state mind and outside environment often get in our way. Since we cannot change them, we must find a way to fight against them, to fight against our low spirits and our distractions. That is---Stick to what we are doing. Not only during class, school day, dragon boat festival, but also summer vocation, extending such character to our beautiful adolescent times. If you allow me to summary the main chord of the essence of adolescence of us, I’d like to answer,” Do not spend your adolescent time lavished, and do make it into a process of persistence?”(別把青春輕易揮霍，何不釀成一場拼搏？) the sentence can also be replaced by what my chemistry teacher said, ”Without efforts, your ideal is no more than a fantasy.”(沒有付出的夢想，只能是空想) So, my friends, don’t hesitate to make your sweat drop onto your desk, into your dormitory, across every corner of those sixteen days.(The Chinese version is more poetic, as I can remember, it goes like, …灑在書桌，灑進宿舍，灑在16天里的每個角角萿落)

This paragraph almost centralizes my most important belief at that time, whose Chinese versions I can remember clearly and write between the parentheses. Perhaps recalling those times often make the present person feel guilty and fall into the sentiment of decorating past adolescent times. While my complex thoughts can not be avoided, I vaguely have basic understanding of the simple beliefs, which I do not intend to write down now, in order not to destroy the fairness of this draft.

The draft ended, but story in real life continued. In fact, I could feel the common effects shared by audiences while the outcome differentiates. After all, I still think leaving memory on notebooks or word document is more secure than no document. This typing can only be regarded as a copy of what I had written. Maybe it inspired you of those fair days of Senior School, not terrible days.
