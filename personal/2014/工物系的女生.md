# 工物系的女生
2014/5/25

She was from the Project Physics Department, fresh female student.
Tonight I happened to sit opposite her. I found she was writing (I thought at that moment) diary. So I could not resist going to look at it while she was away.

About her plan in this summer, she was going to assist teaching in some place. She wants to practice her English and learn to cooperate with others. 

She talks about the superior status of Tsinghua and Peking University, at which students have many privileges that other students from other universities do not have.

She hints the odd air in Tsinghua University. Students are indulged to behave not so well to match with the privileges they have.

Some coolness prevailed in our campus. The club activities and
colorful art activities can never cover the rush towards self interest.

I was touched by the three paragraphs. But at that time, a man came in and I mistook it as the owner of the diary. But as I prepared to look again, she actually came back. I fast returned to my seat.

During the interval at which she went out to get a phone, I wrote a note to apologize for it. And she gave me a message back, which left an simple but powerful sentence:

年轻时尚可实话实说，有胸怀有抱负，不然以后老了就要受各种约束。

我也怕大学的安逸生活让我忘记前进的方向，故作此以自勉。
