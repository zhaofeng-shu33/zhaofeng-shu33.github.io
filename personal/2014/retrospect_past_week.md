# My retrospect of this past week

Imagine such occasion, when you are taking your major class such as Ordinary Differential Equations and you are sitting at the first row. However, a couple sat beside you and to make things worse, the female side is one of the scarce-number lady group of your class. How do you feel during these whole periods?

Unfortunately, I experienced two of such cases within 24 hours and witnessed two different couples, both female sides of which are from my class. Synthesizing such experiences and feelings, I think I can even finish a paper. But I’d like to let them pass away and try to concentrate on more essential problems, at least I think these problems are at my present stage. Before my formal retrospect, I declare that all thoughts below are of my personal views and should not be regarded as the potential ideology output to others. Since at such level, such essay is very likely to be used for such purpose, like many from our party to citizens and western strategies targeted at China.

It’s hard to start with. But the noon of Wednesday is comparatively special and I met my previous subgroup leader of Seeking Truth Association at one canteen. Just like as Britons talked about weather as opening remarks, we began with Marxism. Curiously, an adult besides joined in our discussion, “I have already an occupation but recently I am seeking some convictions. I read Confucianism, Taoism but I think they are too old for me to follow. After I read only a little of Marxism, I found some symphony. But I agree with you (Just now I said I didn’t agree to regard Marxism as Action Compass) that we personally can also learn Marxism as Theoretical System rather than Action Compass, since historical occasions changed so dramatically that we can hardly say ‘Communist Society is inevitable’. I think this form of society is just like a process of passing to the limit （取极限）in mathematic, you can get very near to the limit but you can never reach it.” He said ponderingly. I added soon, “ It is very accidental that you take an example belonging to my major. I wondered my such interpretation was largely influenced by my major background.”

(If you are too disgusted about Marxism, please skip this paragraph.)“Very probably”, the leader, my study sister from Department of Science, said “I’d also like to share a little about my journey of the heart (since I had done in rough a few minutes before) . Before I came here, I was obsessed with Chinese ancient Taoist priest or something similar. I read some about Taoism and tried to imitate them, obscuring peaceful mind by cutting off earthly trifles. Is it possible? I can not answer this fundamental question even now. But according to our common sense (or Marxism), man has to eat, to drink and to sleep. This is the priority. For these Taoist priests or Buddhists, they don’t need consider such trifles only because society provides a surplus amount of means（资料） of life for them. In ancient China, we have a lot of Taoist temples or monasteries, while their residents can have rest in any of them with a passport. This is the material foundations on which these ideologies work out. (free wind added an observation, even at present China, I often find some new Buddhist books in the small high-speed railway stations, declaring their colossal power to cure life spiritual wounds)…”

I still very appreciate such brief and extraordinary application of Marxism to analyze social phenomenon, shared by some of top leaders of this association, while I can only give incoherent and illogical speech on such discussion. (but I don’t mean I totally agree with their development of Marxism and application angles.) “So you totally abandon your past obsession of Taoism?”

“I have to admit, not so thoroughly.”

This afternoon I occupied myself with tape the newspapers “新京报”to windows above the door, while I was suddenly attracted by “too fascinating” title by 莫言近况. By the prompt of this name, I cannot escape reminding myself of another eminent Chinese modern writer余秋雨, to whose works surrender totally.

This Wednesday, I staggered into German classroom with heavy mind and body after the confusion of lecture of electric conduct. The teacher (who mastered in both English and German literature) soon gave my handed German composition  (the one you saw at English Reading one class this Thursday) back with strict voice, “I have said it was not proper to make sentences by yourself. Considering your present stage and your complex German sentence structure, it made hard for others to understand.” Some basic grammar mistakes are denoted by red marks, but that is not fundamental. I was hard pressed, and I seemed to realize my slight neglect of general language skills. After class, some students took the lead to make German presentations next week, while I had to wait for my turn to consult with the teacher about my preparation about Chapter one of Manifest of the Communist Party.

The teacher again at first pointed out my problematic German pronunciation during class, “Have you reviewed this area during the National Day Festival? I seemed to suggest you beforehand.”
“I’m very sorry, teacher, I dare not review this area, because, anyway, I say it, because I take French course this semester, and you know, pronunciation part…”

“How can you be so anxious? You are, let me say, a sophomore, aren’t you? You should have covered German textbook 1-3 and then convert to others. Objectively speaking, that is never a wise choice since---Maybe that’s a language learning wrong region.”

“My original inspiration came from some modern writers, who lead me to seek the footprints of writers at The Republic of China (1911-1949)…(My cultural ancient classical tendency is also largely influenced by these forerunners) ”

“That’s it, they read original literature works right away after they quickly master the grammar structure. But can you imagine consequences of such methods, which totally neglect listening, speaking and writing? In the long run, they spoiled a language. And I doubt they can really appreciate original works, far different from their own propaganda you read before.”

“Since they made such mistakes, then we rectify them soon after the policy of Reform and Opening up?”

“Far from your consideration, even at that time we put some emphasis on writing. But can you imagine, I saw with my own eyes, parting reflecting how Japanese learns English, a graduate can write down extraordinary English paper but he even can not speak out a simple English sentence for conversation. In our ages, with the help of high-tech devices, we have the possibility to develop our general language skills instead of only one specific direction targeted reading, but that needs the transformation of our mind first.”

The motivation for me to wait before the counter to borrow a Mathematical English-Chinese Dictionary origins largely from my reading of mathematical history (You probably notice that such narrative is not consistent with Marxism, which declares material basis first. In my shallow understanding, social material basis changed relatively slowly, in contrast to the short life of an individual. As an individual has only very finite contact, it is possible that his or her behavior has some deviation from the normal standard. Sometimes this deviation might be so huge that from individual’s point of view, it is natural to explain his or her behavior as expression of inner heart. (different from conformity). Thus we human disputes with each other about which is essence, material or awareness?(Sorry to discuss so abstractly, and give no answer.)

But for me, it is very simple. I tried to transform the writing Chinese character (major class especially Ordinary Differential Equation and Mathematical Analysis) on the blackboard to English on my notebook and writing Mathematical Analysis coursework all in English. All such gradual transformations are bases on my following awareness:

“New pursuits have often become possible only because of a new mode of writing…An adequate notation reflects reality better than a previous poor one…”

As you have already contemplated, sure enough this citation came from what I read about mathematical history.  I know it is only adjustment of writing form and matters nothing to whether you can learn mathematics well. But if form could not help us to know truth better, why do we spend time on academic English?  

(1) (2) are mostly opinions of others, which inspired or struck me a lot, while (3) is my immature views about form and essence. Anyway, you can think I merely use writing to pretend to be what I am not at reality most of the time. As one has to finish this or that coursework, as one has to be pressed by kinds of pressures and depressed feelings, it is probably what I use to relieve myself. Maybe some writers also did so, do you agree with me?
