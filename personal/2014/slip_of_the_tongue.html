	<h1>Two times when I had a slip of the tongue</h1>
<p>2014/7/8</p>
<p>By free wind, Class 51 H province </p>
<p>On July 8 of the summer camp</p>
<p>After our responsible male volunteer Richard had presented his travel experience with us, it was my turn to give a presentation. I just wanted a proper translation between his and mine. “A moment ago, Richard gave us a wonderful speech. Her destination is within China, but for my…”
I hadn’t realized that I made a small but fatal mistake at the person usage. Laughter is unavoidable. My embarrassment is also unavoidable. I had to sigh, saying the third person in Chinese is much easier than English.</p>
<p>This afternoon after 4 o’clock, I rushed to underground room to attend a lecture about the love poetry. My male classmate Jason sat just beside me. When the professor asked us about our reading about love poetry, I said something about Song poems. Jason put forward an example, “The great river is flowing towards the east…” So at that time I just wanted to pass the voice turn to him. “Jason can give more explanation. Her knowledge is wider.” I again paint the lily and made a joke. I have to say, mistakes are unavoidable if I try to express my opinion not in mother tongue. May this kind of wrong person be avoided next time!</p>
