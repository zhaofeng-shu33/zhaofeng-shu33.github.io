	<h1>An experience of changing majors</h1>
<p>2014/7/10</p>
<p>Have you guys and girls considered changing your major? But today I am going to talk about whether or not do so. I only want to tell you a true story of my friend who passively changed her major to English. Pay attention, though this story do not happen at THU.</p>
<p>I will use the first perspective to tell the story. </p>
<p>I determined to change my involuntary major into a major called Chinese language, which I was very fond since I was born. I felt despaired because I was not quantified only because my GaoKao grade of Chinese was only one grade lower than their requirement. Anyway, I cursed GaoKao because it trapped me. But my instructor of original academy advised me to apply for English. They said to me, you had high score in Gao English. If you choose English as your major, you will own a promising career in the future.” I hesitated. I thought it again and again. And under pressure finally I applied for changing my major to English. But soon I had second thoughts about the choice. Actually I had not the intention to study English but the passion to study Chinese language. But now all of a sudden I was to take the English exams. </p>
<p>So I didn’t care much about the English exams. I read a lot about beautiful Chinese prose and poems during almost all my free time. Then one day, my carelessness about the English exam was found by my English teacher. She is a typical super lady in North of China. After she made quick analysis of the advantage of English, she found I was still hesitated at such a turning point. She was steaming and used her final method. She said, “Now your academy is helping you find your future. How should you thank your academy except successfully changing your major to English?”</p>
<p>Her stimulation took its effect. It aroused my self-dignity and unyielding spirit in my mind. I have to say, this sense of gratification came out of myself.      </p>
<p>So I went crazy in the following days. I finished a vocabulary book in three days, grammar practice in two days, and then the reading comprehension… Any reference book which I can find did I look through.
After I passed my writing exam, interview is waiting for me. I have much more difficulty dealing with interview because of my background of English education. After I had experienced the dumb English training for 6 years, I knew how bad my oral English was.</p>
<p>At long last, I passed the interview and began English major lessons with other English-major students.</p>
<p>Then the nightmare began. I could not understand what the English teacher was saying. I felt nervous whenever I was faced with foreign teacher. To make things go from bad to worse, I had not great passion for English. A few months later, I adapted myself to my new major but I still wondered about my future and had a lingering fear of my experience of changing major to English.</p>
<p>The story ends. Of course this is a story of changing majors but this is also a lively picture of Chinese education and confusion of teenager. In my opinion, we should learn to adapt to new environment, even though it was not the perfect image in our mind.   </p>
