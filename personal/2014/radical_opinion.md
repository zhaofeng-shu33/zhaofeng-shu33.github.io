# Radical opinion summary
2014/10/26

Dear Denny

Glad to receive your reply. Since I find I can not get up at 6:00.

In order to get up early to read French and German, I can not type this email in this afternoon.

I don’t know if this email is proper, particularly concerning about the part of my radical opinions.

Another hesitation lies at whether I should keep this as a personal diary. I have to admit that higher percentage of my writing about myself is in the form of email, and more of them are starting from ideas and use examples to prove rather than telling an incident and getting a lesson. Somehow I will be exhausted without writing something in a period. Maybe there is no difference between typing in such way and playing computer games, regardless of what language you use. I’m actually in such a state and feel writing to the other person as a better way than to myself.

Anyway, what I’ve said is too personal and seems to make myself hard understood. In order to avoid such difficulty, I mentioned the main contents in this email at the beginning to hint myself  to structure this informal email well.

1. Metaphysical inspiration
1. Saint Awareness
1. My Radical opinions against historical dialectics

I can start either from what inspiration I get from mathematical analysis class or what I read about mathematical history. But that is not as intense as my direct question to a brilliant assistant of mathematical analysis. This is the third semester that we are blessed to be taught by him every Friday night at the same classroom since September last year. In the last two semesters, due to my improper methodology based on unclear world view, I had little gain though he taught very well. At least this semester I had some change---at least I try to regard science from the view of natural philosophy, thus distinguishing totally my major from pure technical manipulation.

I have already talked to you about what we learn in this course at present: the conditions on which two limit passage processes can be commutated. The classical three examples have been taught at class by the professor. Many problems of the coursework are similar proof under other different conditions. However, my imitating skills are not so sharp that I take a whole evening to finish the coursework with the help of “answer hints”. Although our coursework has not be submitted, the assistant, whose name is translated as “Encouragement’, elucidate them in a systematic way.

Encouragement said the keynote of this class, “Only what we learn this week belong truly to mathematical analysis, not to calculus. So the wonder just begins.” You’d better omit the following three paragraphs since I talked in detail about this course. (The status of Uniform Continuity is mentioned in the third paragraph of the three.)

It is easy for advance learners to introduce a more general theorem and apply it with minor modification to prove many versions of many problems on our textbook. If it is just so much, I have not so much gain this Friday evening. By drawing a uniform “commutative graph”（交换图）, listing all the conditions on the graph, and applying the method called “三分法”, can we quickly find the core step and work out the problem. On the contrary, getting the essential from the conditions (1)(2)(3), which are put in three different lines, is very difficult. Maybe half of my difficulty in finishing related coursework lies at my bewilderment at so many mathematical symbols in one problem. By such bound, I can not figure out which estimate I should make by

N-ε language and when “三分法” should be used to prove the given proposition.

Occasionally I read a little about the concise mathematical history. One point of this book illustrating the reason of great advance of mathematical development is the improvement of mathematical symbols. Because ancient Greece use alphabet letters to denote numbers, their further development is impeded. Because Britain stuck to Newton’s fluxion (the symbols are archaic), their mathematical achievement is far behind that of France. In this sense, the use of “communicative graph” is not only a formal transformation, but a great leap forward for us to see clearly when the conditions (on which two limit passage processes can be changed) are satisfied.

After class, I asked Encouragement about the application of “Uniform Continuity” in our course. His answer is summarized as follows: In the concept itself it is far less important than uniform convergence, and we seldom use it to prove other fundamental theorems in our course. (I mention an important conclusion, any continuous function on a closed interval is integrable, the first proof of which is the use of Cantor-Heine theorem (every continuous function on a closed interval is uniform continuous), then we can use the definition of uniform continuous to estimate the Riemann sum. Plus, Fubini Theorem is proved by Darboux Criterion for integral function, which even does not require the continuity of the integrand. ) but you should know the ideas behind this concept is fundamental, which requires a function is not only continuous at every point of its domain, but they can be manipulated by a common δ, which only relies on x. All the concepts of uniformity share the same character. Besides, the proof of Cantor-Heine theorem is also fundamental, which is a typical proof using the continuity of real numbers, or more specifically, propositions equivalent to Finite Cover Theorem. You should not forget this is the first time for a beginner to get touch with such ideas and proof norms. In this meaning, uniform continuity belongs to mathematical analysis, not to calculus, in which function continuity is enough.

After this detail question, I asked Encouragement more and more philosophical questions. Some answers of him inspired me a lot: In a broad sense, mathematical analysis is teaching us technically how we can handle some specific objects. It remains at the level of methodology, and does not reach the level of world view.

“But some concepts introduced in our course are very philosophical, like the concept of limit.” (According to concise mathematical history, Lagrange built his theory without this concept. He didn’t believe two infinitesimal can be compared to a finite number.)

“Maybe, but mostly in history. I feel in our times, mathematics is more and more degrading from that height. I mean from the height of epistemology. Mathematical philosophy is far from main stream.”

“But even we can build a philosophical theory different from social science, I feel only mathematicians can understand what we are talking about.”

“That’s probably not so absolute. I read some books in which philosophers talk about mathematics. Some of which should be so deep level that I believe even persons who generally choose mathematics as Minor can not achieve. Odd persons in the world!”

“Anyway, even mathematicians change as they grow older. ( I mentioned some great mathematicians in western Europe demonstrate the existence of God using natural science.) How can you anticipate what your practical attitude will remain unmoved?”

“(After commenting on my question. He gave me a piece of advice:) Thinking in such metaphysical way is not bad, but it is natural to think gradually as you learn more mathematics. Hence the main question now is how to pass the exams of mathematical analysis. That is fundamental for you, I think.”

The second part of this email can be constructed based on Confucianism. Since I only knew a few about this theory, I’m sorry I can not construct well.

My question awareness came from what I knew about your level at English and natural science. I omit further explanation at present. Anyway, it is probably a comparison induced mental state. This problem is never modern. In Mencius, Mencius answered a question from his disciple, “if we can become saint by learning (even if we are not intelligent enough).” The absolute positive answer is inherited by 朱熹, a leading Chinese Confucian philosopher in Song Dynasty. I can not totally comprehend their explanations around this question. But some key words have great influence on me, 义理栽培; 天之生是民也，使)先知觉后知，… The first phrase emphasize the importance of rationality while the second sentence is about methodology. It seems interesting that every wide accepted ideas hold similar opinions about equality. This is maybe why the quick breakdown of Hitlerism. But if we look carefully at the superficial “equality”, we find great inequality (except communism). I only talk about Confucianism. Saints exist in this theory, which became a model for others. It emphasize that 有生而知之者，有不学而能者，有学而知之者. Thus the intelligent has the ability to lead others while others should obey the intelligent. In a literary summary, the others should “愿受一廛（house）而为圣人氓（people）”.

I had not enough examples around me this week to illustrate my gradually adjusted attitude to handle my inferiority on some areas. All the Chinese quotations I use are deeply absorbed in my heart, which I also try not to disturb natural science ideology.



I had intended to write down only the third part. But my small progress at mathematical analysis produces the first part and your excellence pushed me to think out the second part.

Anyway, you may misunderstand me as a patriot and a defender of current Chinese system, based on my external enthusiasm towards Marxism. So I’d like to make a key note summary about my attitude on such matters.

Seven months ago, I was typically what you think I am now. Then two areas of things happened.

1 Seeking Truth Association is not a patriotic association, but a ruthlessly criticizing platform towards current Chinese system. I learned “The Capital” in the last semester and summer vocation from this association. In this process many Chinese examples are used to explain our current problems. Actually I am still an out-stander of Marxism political economy and I had not personal opinion on such area. But if I had ever any gain from this association, that were critical thoughts.

2 Two historical courses I take last semester had great influence on me. Luckily they are not based on historical dialectics and gradually crashed my previous historical view filled in by High School historical books. Actually I had limit gain of historical knowledge from the two courses, but two theses I write at the end of semester predicted what I thought today. One is 孟子義理在明代的實踐, which analyzed Ming history from the point of ideology. The other is从十七年文学看“文学工具论”的时代特征, which analyzed the influence of politics on literature development from 1949-1976 in mainland China. The second thesis ended as follows, which I enlarge this attitude to many current affairs now.

对于十七年文学中的文学阶级斗争论，我们的态度是明确的，它是文学工具论的变态化，极端化的产物，它唯文学的社会功能是尊，让文学沦为政治的附庸…

At the end of last semester, I realize there are great contradictions between 1 and 2. Association members give great tribute to Seventeen year literature and claim it is necessary to educate literary and art workers at that time, otherwise newly-born China will be ruined by remnants of Bourgeoisie ideology. And as you know, historical dialectics are totally of Marxism, which is obviously opposing analyzing history from the point of my two aforementioned theses.

I gradually realized Seeking Truth Association treats “Marx-Lenin-Mao” as a sacred inheriting line to study, the third of which hesitated me a lot. Anyway, I quitted their organizations for many reasons.

All the above are what I thought a month ago. As time passed, it had new development.

I had intended to systematically learn Marxism this semester and had more appreciate of Ancient Europe history. However, I was not lucky as last semester, or objectively speaking, the two professors are of supporter of current Chinese system. This tendency, as our English Reading one teacher said, will ruin this course. He will involuntarily pass the newest leadership spirit to students and explain Marxism in current accepted way. The most disappointing for me is at Ancient Europe History course, in which the professor explained the history totally according to historical dialectics, a cliche to me. One immature analysis of me about 12.9 is typical of my ideology.


(I wrote it last weekend)

I wanted to make a short comment on 1-29. This event has already been memorized deeply in Chinese students’ mind thanks to《纪念刘和珍君》, which requires passage recitation in my high school. My last impression of this event did not stay at the patriotic symbol of 1-29 martyr such as our alumni, but at an English novel 京华烟云, in which a tragedy happened to a family around this event because the elder daughter joined this event and sacrificed. Unlike official emphasis on the crime of 北洋 government and righteous leadership of communist party in this student movement, the novel author, 林语堂，while condemning 段祺瑞 government, also considered the blame on the university part: should young students be instigated to join such political movement on the false promise of safety given by some organization?

So now I wonder, is there special meaning holding such massive ceremony activity? If it is only to teach Chinese citizens, especially college students to memorize the stigma of nation, we have had enough such memorization. If it is to encourage us to study harder to make our country suffer no more in the future, then such purposes can be achieved better if we take more mathematical analysis courses than joining such activity. The only explanation lies at the political significance. By such activity we can prove the righteous leadership of our party in the modern history of China and we can become more united around this party in the future. There is nothing wrong to do so. But there is also no essential difference from official activity such as sacrifice to heaven or ancestors in ancient China.

To speak objectively, the background of 1-29 is very complex, which involves many big powers in the world. I think every student at our university shares the inferior feelings towards western world even without joining any such activities. We are bound to think what we can do to change at least slightly such passive situation instinctively, since we are never separated from our cultural roots: language, traditional spirits and past experience of ourselves or our ancestors. The only difference lies in our choice of ways to achieve such unaware goal, which is already injected into our own personal dreams. Others are merely political elements, which are transitory, unreasonable sometimes and even meaningless compared to our cultural continuity.

I had thought carefully what the problem with our application with historical dialectics was. I knew this theory itself had great advantage but I was disgusted whenever I read or hear it in the Chinese language background. Generally speaking, history is very splendid, but some people wanted to simply it to nothing by using historical dialectics. Since time is limited and I had not enough examples to prove my arguments, I didn’t write down the third part in a scientific way.

I intended to learn the two courses by myself from the next week, but…

a great dilemma arose: Should I be present at the course of the Basic Principle of Marxism? As a well-behaved student who never skipped class, this is a tough question for me. But on thinking of the political-right Marxism education, I maybe have no other choice.

Yours
