# My love view 
2014/11/11

Dear Denny,

At the very beginning, you should understand my motive to write about such a subtle topic, which has no relation with the date of boys, which is endowed special meanings by the numbers of this date.

Of course every THU intellectual can write an elaborate sentence on this topic without any difficulty, considering its nearness to our daily life and all the allusions we've memorized. For me, I will just synthesize what happened to me within this problem with the combination of letters I read this whole morning.

The prelude to my reading of "Letters to a young poet" by German poet Rilke is unnecessary to be explained in detail. Only some remarks are needed. 

(1) Since original language is so difficult and time-confusing for me that what I read is English translation edition. There seems to be a word, “World Literature”. I think it means you can read all of them just using one language. Of course only most famous and influential literature can belong to this category. Anyway, what I talk this time should have little to do with language.

(2) The translator holds the view that the letters are very fit for 20-year old or so adolescences to read, because the letter writer, Rilke spoke directly to a young poet, whose problems and ages we share. Of all the fundamental topics Rilke covered, Love and Sex are included, which Rilke "offers unguarded thoughts on".

We talk about feminism in the previous *English Listening One* class. It is interesting to remember that the speaker in TED is a female writer. Why writers have so much inspiring thoughts to share, not a scientist? What I've done with regret is diverting the topic to IQ of young lady, the cause of which I can not remember clearly. "This problem" probably has connected itself to the predominant voice power by male gender. I also find Rilke mentioned this problem:

*Love in literature isn't an entirely mature and pure sexual world, for it is not human enough; it is merely male, heat, intoxication and restlessness, burdened with the old prejudices and haughtiness with which man has distorted and burned love.*

I think he shared his idea with Adichie and Virginia Woolf, whose points of view I quoted in class. Whatever to say, this problem is not less near me than the following one (pardon my slight escape from the topic, my love view):

(In the fourth letter, Rilke said)*…if you stick with nature, with whatever is straightforward in it, with those small objects that hardly anyone ever sees and that can suddenly turn into something great immeasurable; if you truly have such a love for insignificant and, quite simply, as someone who wishes to serve, seek to gain the confidence of the seemingly impoverished, then you will find that everything will become easier, more consistent and more malleable, perhaps not in your intelligent, which, astonished, will fall behind, but in your innermost consciousness, alertness, and knowledge. (to the young poet) You are so young, so far from any beginning; I should like to ask you as well as I can, to show patience towards everything in your heart that has not been resolved and to try to cherish the questions themselves, like sealed rooms and books in a language that is very foreign. <span style="color:red;">Do not hunt for the answers just now</span>---they cannot be given to you because you cannot live them. <span style="color:red;">What matters is that you live everything</span>. One day perhaps you will gradually and imperceptibly live your way into the answer. Perhaps you do carry within yourself the possibility of shaping and creating, which is an especially blessed and pure way of life; train yourself towards that end—but accept whatever comes with complete confidence, and should it come solely through your will, through some inner need, accept it and <span style="color:red;">do not hate anything.</span>*

Rilke is regarded a most lyrical writer. I think such lyrical description is more difficult to catch by listening than by reading. Maybe writing is a more advanced expression of complex feelings. And the time (the letters were written around 1903) and space distance of these letters made the description more complex if you neglect factors of our language level.

Three sentences are marked red because I think they are very similar to what you said to me in the last email. At this point, I will not respond to the descriptions above and return to my topic, since Rilke said immediately after the last red sentence:

*True, sex is difficult. But such difficulties have been imposed upon us, almost everything serious is difficult, and everything is serious. If you can simply recognize this and succeed in establishing an entirely individual relationship with sex(one not influenced by convention and propriety) through your own disposition and nature, through your experience and childhood and power, then you need no longer fear losing yourself and becoming unworthy of your most valuable possession.*

Then Rilke had wonderful discussion of sex, starting from physical desire. It is uncommon in these letters since most of the times Rilke simply gave direct opinions to the young poet with little analysis. But at this point, the analysis is sufficient. However, I don't think it is proper to quote the description of sex by Rilke here, because there seems to exist ethic lines in my heart that can appreciate but cannot receive Rilke’s unguarded thoughts. Since his conclusion is generalized universally, I quote it here:

*Perhaps the sexes are most related than we suspect, and perhaps the great renewal of the world will come about when men and girls, freed from all crazed feelings and deadened appetites will seek each other not as opposites but as siblings and neighbors, and unite as human beings so that they may simply, seriously and patiently (face such problem)*.

I also deliberately changed the latter part of the last sentence based on the same reason. Anyway, what I did above was merely transferring what I made notes of to the computer. I cannot figure out whether language or literature form, or ideas struck me most. Below is my own view of love, which changed very little across these years, totally unlike my political view or science view.

The most difficulty for me to write the following several paragraphs is the close relation of this topic to my reality, in particular, to the receiver of this email. I will think over and moderate my dictions below.

Strictly speaking, I've never wrote love poem, some of which were really clumsy parodies of ancient Chinese poems or verses. In a general sense, my literary writing on such topic was mainly in the form of a whole essay, whose genre was more similar to incomplete biography of a girl, or more accurately, trivial things which happened between I and her. Many of them were done under the cover of one students-self-organized literary association. And to strengthen my literary writing on such topics or out of other motives, I naively recited some Song Poems. By now I cannot figure out why I would recite twenty poems from《花间词》and twenty poems by 李清照 at that time.

Why I said "strictly speaking" in the preceding paragraph? I think perhaps one fundamental essay 《调味剂和必需品》 by me in Senior High Two is enough to illustrate my love view. Unfortunately, I only had the writing form of this essay and I left the essay at my hometown. The core idea is that I think 情 is sauce of life, which is not trivial while 奋斗 is essentials. This pair of contradictions almost runs through all my compositions relating to love. This is probably part of the reasons why I adored 李清照 and Madame Curie (居里夫人) and later 钱忠书，since their marriage is not purely love-driven.

In the past years in middle school, I made acquaintances with and even admired a few girls, almost with each of whom I had sent plenty of emails, the topic of which is mainly around my striving for a certain particular goal. Of course the goal changed thoroughly while my writing habits were preserved. One typical concern of me at Senior High One is described by the following email to one humanity-tended girl 王涵: (pay attention to my view of striving at that time)

(6/19/2011)对于过去的一周——期末复习的倒数第二周，高一生涯的倒计时，高考成绩四处流窜之时，事业编考试 (local administrative examination, passers of which can get a job at one sub-institution of government in my hometown)几家欢喜几家愁的这一周，我的心态却像 下开口 抛物线般的——以越来越大的加速度滑向x轴以下，虽然表面上还可以故作镇静。

诸如亚洲各国遭遇狂风暴雨的自然灾害，利比亚战事越过了百天的门槛，台湾开放陆客自由行箭在弦上，台湾的2012选战也打得如火如荼，这些毕竟太遥远，每天面对学校的操场，最现实的事情毕竟是各科的作业和下一节自习的安排。

昨天晚上（及前后的时间）对大多数人是假期(My high school is semi-boarding. During a regular short vacation，students from rural areas can go home.) 该留下来的还是不会走。第一节晚自习，一方面5班(my class)的足球爱好者飞快地追逐着“梦想”，另一方面6班(competitors of my class)的精英破天荒地抱着篮球冲进了操场。不过每个大课间5班都会沉浸于足球，6班门口，都鲜有人驻足停留。

本来 5班 在班主任的威慑下 成了全年级留人最多，今天却被刘校长臭骂一顿——“所谓留，就有优越感吗？看看你们的行为，简直不比走的同学强多少。”很多时候自己也是凭着所谓的“优越感”使自己更优越，马不停蹄的新课，我可以有舍有得。但在复习的时间里，不该舍的舍，花了大量时间在不太有作用的事情上。数学课，无论是期末复习还是综合练习，在大片空白中我截取1~2题去做，只要求答案，常常还是出错。确实错过了不少好题，更重要的是失去训练计算能力的机会。结果三角题，总是出错。化学课，所有的作业都做，酯化反应的方程式照着n遍写（每张卷中都有），但大量的题目，大量的小错，至于新题型，讲过是会了，但总不能遇到新题就不会。物理课，物理小计算，思路对，动能定理的方程式经常出错，尤其在代入数据一个环节，计算的错误累累，——尽管物理是3科中在校用时最多的。

一切好坏都是比出来的，自从听说6班精英们定下的期末目标后（争第二），自从student A的一句“真正的目标，是放在心里的”，自从看到student A’, student B’ (the student with the apostrophe denotes students from class six, while students without the apostrophe comes from my class) 他们在下课铃响的同时冲出教室，决心以最快速度完成晚饭时，自从我从未在课间见到他们时，我知道也许自己不如他们努力。

即使这样呢？student A的高效我也是赶不上的，他只是抓住了3节晚自习，在班会上坦承自己自习课不会太分心，和我的“平均3节自习1节认真2节疲惫”有很大的对比。至于班里的student B理科优势也更为明显。当自己不惜花整节整节的自习为1道数学题苦苦思索，还是在别人不经意的提醒中有了思路（三角复习的一道求值域的题），有道题还是和老师得到完全相同的结论——题出错了（三角综合复习的最后一题）。

… 

不足，失望，差距，改进，很多感想交织在一起，渐渐去延长晚上熄灯时间，尽管不能像在校那样较为高效。如今可利用的晚上还有一周，强制自己去做某一件事。（有时在家对自己还是要求太松，一会看看这个，一会翻翻那个）

翻非常学案时看到一句话：没有真实的现在，何谈过去与未来？240人进了面试圈(I mean the local administrative examination)，考上的，额手称庆；名落孙山者，是否还有重头再来的勇气——那也要等一年。高考也是。(End of this email)

Almost three years later, I wrote another email to the same girl S. There are invariants while something happens at least. Maybe it is very proper to share this email. But as it passed before I made acquaintance with you was the unique email which directly showed my love view, I showed the whole email as follows:
<div style="padding-left:20px;padding-right:20px;">
(2014 August 8th) Dear S:

How are you?

This is probably the most different letter that I had ever sent to you. It concentrates no more about knowledge and my study life, but makes documents of my troubled feelings.

With prejudice and complacence came I back to hometown. It seemed I put many things beyond my notice, but I can not put down one kind of thing---spiritual love (forgive me using this term) for someone else. To express it I rely heavily on the Internet ---If the Internet is of bad state at home, I was very angry and depressed.

What I am concerned often tortured me more because of no reply from the other side. It was strange for a reasonable modern citizen to fall into such traps, which nearly make him lose interest on all the other things.

Because of this problem, I found my sleeping state was disturbed, which was added a long sleepless prelude and odd dreams; Because of this problem, I found my main study of math and physics was disturbed, which was accompanied with distraction and mechanism;Because of this problem, I found my eating was disturbed, at which time my mind was trying to think of method to make contact with you; Because of this problem, I found my climbing (mountain) experience was a little disturbed, at which time I can not feel the nature very freely.

But what I'd like to say if I can contact you or meet you? Maybe about your English classes and your attitude about English literature; Maybe to hand a gift which I bought with virtual shells at English camp store and an English novel which I was rewarded in one English class to you; Maybe…

At present I conceive a lot while it is a little. I can not forget my English teacher of Junior three but when I try to contact her, her attitude of life "Doing myself in realistic life" makes me backward three inches. As I can remember, in first semester at THU I happened to be in a false lecture about how to learn English, given by a simultaneous interpreting expert. But the lecture proved to be an encouragement lecture, spoken in Chinese. In my present view, encouragement was of little use, which reflected merely the worldly value points of success. It was neither Confucian nor Marxism. But at this point I want to repeat his mentioning of one girl.

The excellent expert said, "When I met this new colleague and heard her perfect work, I was impressed and thought she must come out of either foreign language university of Beijing or Shanghai. But afterwards when I knew her background, I was surprised. She was not majoring in English in her under-graduate education and came out of a second-level college! But how can she be so successful?...(He talked about the importance of resume, which I thought lower value.)"

(As I can remember, she was probably majoring in law.) "She began to make her English note in major class or Marxism class. If she felt the class was boring, she translate the (law) textbook in English to kill time. The quick reaction which is formed by conscious self-training like hers is of vital importance in simultaneous interpreting, you know…"

What the expert said I felt no such strength at that time, maybe you would think it was too hard to only write in English in your notebook. But what makes difference is her later transformation…

Before I told the heard story, I intended to sign, maybe you will follow your given path to become a middle-school English teacher, just like my respected junior 3 English teacher. After I told the heard story, I felt that maybe I had no qualification to become a virtual educator. Since presently I disliked those peers who spread their so-called success to young study brothers and sisters. Even success people make a lot of mistakes, let alone immature types.

Maybe all what I said was merely to hide my emerged feelings toward you. What is the influence of the use of English to write to you or even almost anyone? Maybe it is to make the writing contains less water. …

<p align="right">Sincerely,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Definitely, even if I can not hold my feelings in some sentences, the retelling of an encouraging story shows that part of my trouble is not purely love. It is the contradictions between love and striving. And I find the former hammers the latter heavily during the initial days after I came back to my hometown.

I never degrade the former---pure feeling towards the other person, and I appreciate it and even try to reconcile it with striving during these years. That is probably why I wrote so many emails in total while I had limited face-to-face communication with these girls. But as some part of my academic learning becomes deep, I become tired of this kind of email---partly because I almost never get the reply coming from the same world, and partly because it in some extents hammers my academic learning. But what is the shaft I will make use of without this kind of form? I have no answer now.

It is strange that I think I clearly expressed my contradiction in the English Reading class only without uttering the name of the girl I mentioned. Maybe it is just a kind of passion. Actually, there is no responsibility, no promise and even no concrete realization in reality. Maybe I just treat a new one spiritually as my confidante. This kind of passion often grows wildly in vacation and sometimes I could not restrain myself from anticipation Short Message from you. What is my methodology to deal with that? Maybe writing all of these emails is one. But since I do not put this pair of contradiction before the three pairs of contradictions in my last letter, I anticipate I can afford whatever the reply is and a relationship of good, common friends or even strangers.

At the very end, I add one irrelevant joke made by me which again reflected my love view:

"Please Hand in geography homework!" exclaimed Snow Darling after class. And the so-called homework was "finishing page 3-33 of geography help-study reference book."

"Give me a share to copy, please, Reverend Geography Representative Lady." Begged one short-height guy, Forest.

"No way, I must bring all of them to the office of geography. You can copy the standard answer instead!"

"But…you know, the answer has too many Chinese characters and not convenient to copy since it was attached after the main part of the reference book."

"I have no obligations to help you in such a matter. But I have to warn you in advance, if you do not hand in the homework immediately, I will mark your name and the geography teacher will find you himself!" Hardly had she finished her sentence, stepped she away from Forest's desk with a pile of reference book in hand. "Wait a minute, my merciful Representative!"

"Blame on you since you haven’t finished …"Snow Darling's laughter vanished gradually as she stepped out of the classroom and ran along the corridor to the office.
