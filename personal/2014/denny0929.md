This must be quite absurd for me to write an email to someone I knew so little. But a memory struck me and I was pushed to express it in this informal and impolite way.

If my memory didn’t cheat me and if there are not so many the same Chinese names at THU, I connected your name with the person who I met at the West Playground during Military Training Time.

It was probably a very common affair, since we met so many peers every day, wearing the same military clothes and receiving the same instructions. But I wondered at my clearness of such memory.

Somehow, our mathematical department team (containing three sub-teams) was brought to the West Playground to get joint training of “military boxing”. At first some students are eliminated because of their irregular movement. Naturally, I was one of the eliminators. But our small group could not enjoy ourselves besides, let alone leaving there. A special training was prepared for us---Learning Prostrating. But the special trainer (instructor) was so generous that soon we were too free to sit down and watch the performance of military boxing.

Weather also cared for us at that time. With no hot sun and some softy wind, we have nothing to do than playing with our mobile phone. How childish we were at that time! Just a few days before, I copied the method of a “study master” to recite English words by electric dictionary. But it was a little boring to memorize every English word by looking at the alphabet and Chinese meanings…

Then an eliminated group of another team sat beside ours. I spotted a tall girl keeping her eyes on a small self-made word book. I could not resist my curiosity and dared to borrow it from her. If my memory didn’t mislead me, I also made a small talk with her---only one sentence remains me now---“This is what I kept in Senior High…” At that time, every obedient student has his or her name card nipped on upper clothes. Somehow I kept her three Chinese characters in mind probably because of her too big font. Anyway, it was the simple retrospect and the ending of the whole story.

You can stop here and delete this email since the following is trivial and written as my recent reflection. You do not worry about the disappearance of such reflection since I will keep a copy of my every written email before I sent it.  

Sincerely

Free wind


As life continues, past and present are not totally severed. Based on my experience of compulsory attendance of class meeting just ten days ago, I thought every sophomore students experienced similarly. During such a class meeting, every one has to make a short summary publicly. Someone used the past year wisely while others badly. I was in the middle, objectively speaking. All these could not be hided from his or her posture and words on the platform.

However, honestly speaking, I was not and could not truly consider such summary unless I was once again involved into the fast-pace new semester. One thing is enough to push me to redefine “Science”, which is misunderstood by myself so far.

In fact, I already noticed the problems of “Chinese language environment” at science and the different ways of construction given by different textbooks. But that was not enough to push me to redefine “Science”. The momentum came from my mathematical analysis teacher, Z.

Z is still himself and stressed the rationality whenever explaining a new concept or formula. But my “preparatory translation” made me start to understand his concern.

In the only previous Saturday last week, I read a lecture note provided by Z---“Starting from deduction of Newton’s gravitational law, Talking about the difference between pure mathematics  and applied mathematics.” Z already stressed on the fact that the gravitational law is not guessed out by great scientist Newton, but deduced from Kepler’s three laws of planet movement and Newton’s three laws of movement. Probably the deduction made by Z is imitating Newton’s original thoughts, only expressing it in a modern and concise way.

The process of deduction relies heavily on the plane polar coordinate, which gave the relative form of velocity and acceleration, which were already familiar to Physics students, but unfamiliar to us. By such manipulation of physics, I was inspired to deduce the gradient expression in the polar coordinate, which means finding the gradient of a scalar field f(r,θ) by the new coordinate vectors er and eθ(there should be arrows on the corresponding vectors). The most tricky fact lies on the appearance of 1/r before the partial derivative of f(r,θ) with respect toθ.  In our core course mathematical analysis, there was specially a chapter discussing abstractly of gradient, curl and divergence ( “Basic Introduction of Field Theory”), which provides a unified demonstration of such problems when you change the Cartesian coordinate to curvilinear coordinate. But the preparation of such “perfect” demonstration is very long. I know such unification is very important in our major but sometimes I find difficulty in corresponding them to special example. Sorry, I missed my key point---redefinition of science.

Two days before I went to office of Z and somehow the topic converted to the question “what is science”. Without the formality of lecture, Z talked more directly, “modern science origins from Newton’s era and only exists in mathematics and physics.” I probably made up the latter part of the proposition. But I asked further about Chemistry, “In chemistry we often have fundamental rules?” “But that’s different from physics at least. You heard a lot about experience formula based on plenty of experiment figures. But in physics, you can construct the whole mechanic system starting from Newton’s three laws. At the same time, the experiment demonstration of Newton’s laws is quite simple. The same thing can be said about electromagnetism.” I kept in silence, and Z went on, “The problems lie in the incomplete development of some subjects. Take biology for example, modern biology has very short time compared to physics or modern mathematics. The mortal problem is that in this subject there are no fundamental laws…”

Probably I also mixed my ideas into what Z had said. But my definition of science is influenced by Z and what I read and how I read recently. There is no doubt that many subjects use mathematics as their tools like economics, which is heavily attacked by my Marxism teacher. But few can be called a science when two explanation systems exist paralleled. In retrospect of my experience of studying mathematics and University Physics, every new structure treated the old one as the special case or low-level form of it. However, in so-called social science, we still knee to read Marx while others made heavy assault on the founder.

I never mean to degrade social science, since their research is another system which is unfamiliar to science students. But in the inner department of science, by clarifying the definition of science, I will begin to find out what is important in science development and why it is important. At considering such questions, language is secondary or subordinate considerations, since language education is no more transitory technique training compared with science education…
