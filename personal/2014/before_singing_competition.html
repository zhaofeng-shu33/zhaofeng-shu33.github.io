	<h1>Before the day when the singing competition is held</h1>

<p>Smile:</p>
<p>More than ten months there were no contacts between us. How are you now?
With little knowledge about you since our graduation from Senior School, I did not know what to share with you besides the following story, which is on the top of my QQzone. </p>
<p>English translation of the story “Before the day when the singing competition is held” first written on May 12th, 2009</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I can not imagine how you feel after reading my translation. For me, it was of long past recollection and touched me only a little. The protagonist, Dawn Feather, stood out in this essay and her image at that time was left forever in that essay. After almost six years, everyone changed so much that the innocent heart was drowned. I never intended to talk like tone of College Entrance Examination Chinese Composition. I only added one more my observation: One of my best friend, was concentrating on this exam or that (Graduate) Exam almost the whole summer vacation.</p>
<p>But this translated essay or original essay half belonged to contemporary literary writing, which means that topic-unrelated materials were filtered away and a perfect image was presented to readers. As I can remember, I was crazy about Campus Literature before high school and read piles of them. To say that this essay ““Before the day when the singing competition is held” was not influenced by those reading is lying. So even if the incident was of most part true. My feelings in the essay were too much idealistic. Even now, I abandoned so many past tendencies but I could not abandon such feelings. So I will translate it into another language. So I will remind myself of you and write to you. So I will please you to revise this essay totally as you like.</p>
<p>If you’d like to talk about yourself, I will be glad to read it.
Your free wind </p>
<p>(2015 10 16) Note: Even not so idealistic, even after artistic manipulation, limitation of the protagonist can be seen clearly. Just like the case in Red Mansion, where the main female character宝钗 stuck to contemporary orthodox ideas. Dawn Feather is also typical of Campus Times. Reads should focus on all her shining points, which gives out in a not fully-grown agency. But educational system behind can also be explored, just as in the case of exploration of deep meaning behind the Red Mansion. Probability the author had never taken such criticism into consideration when the works is written. But readers can find after meditation, and maybe the most sarcastic word uttered by innocent Dawn Feather is “after that visit, I knew that grades, only grades were great comfort for both teachers and parents.”</p>
