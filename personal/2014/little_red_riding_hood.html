	<h1>Reaction to "little red riding hood"</h1>
<p>2014/8/11</p>
<p>Dear Paula,</p>
<p>This is my first time using English to write about one of the German fable which I had read tonight. So some German words will be mixed but only a little because of the inconvenience of typing inflexion letters by keyboard. 
Tonight I once again made through of the story translated as “Little Red Riding Hood” (Rotkaeppchen), which was a very popular fable even in China. It was perhaps absurd to reread fables of children only to learn German language. But since some scholars wrote thesis on the German fables, they can never be simple as they present to us.</p>
<p>But for beginners, the reading experience was not interesting at all. I can remember of my first time of systematically reading original English classical works---Jane Eyre at Senior Two. But two years before one series of “Book Insect” has been read relatively smoothly by me. As for German fables, there was no doubt much difficulty for one-year German-learner to read continuously for around 1000 words.</p>
<p>To return to the fable itself, actually the story has many editions even in German language. I found the first appearance of this story was more than 100 years old and contained some old German words and their usages. That is not beginners should pay attention to so that I find a rather-modern editions to read through. Plot is no problem compared with detail comprehension. I find difficulty in understanding many long broken sentences partly due to my weak German grammar training. Choice of words is relatively ample, for example, “schnell” is a very common word to describe likewise quickly, but in the fable “geschwind” was used in stead of “schnell”. This word appeared to describe the speed of the little girl in her action of fetching big stones to put into the belly of the wolf.</p>
<p>An amusing pot appeared when the wolf pretended to be the grandmother of the little girl and answered her naïve questions. I copied the sentences below to share with you:</p>
<p>»Ei, Großmutter, was hast du für große Ohren!« »Daß ich dich besser hören kann.« »Ei, Großmutter, was hast du für große Augen!« »Daß ich dich besser sehen kann.« »Ei, Großmutter, was hast du für große Hände« »Daß ich dich besser packen (hold) kann.« »Aber, Großmutter, was hast du für ein entsetzlich (frightful) großes Maul!« »Daß ich dich besser fressen kann.«</p>
<p>Firstly you find the ordered words in every line. But after we read amusingly the German sentences. We feel vaguely the difference of language though we cannot tell clearly. If the sentences were translated in English or in Chinese, it can seldom keep the sentence structure ( was fuer, dass… (I can not make out the usage of “dass” here, use “damit” to describe the aim is more reasonable. What is your opinion? ) ) and the tense air between the wolf and the innocent little girl.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the story I read was appended with a sequel. It tells briefly a plot when grandmother and the little girl met another wolf and how they cleverly make the wolf drown himself. In my opinion, the sequel of classical story was unnecessary. Even though we treasure the figures in the original story, we should remain them as it was. Ridiculously, I was obsessed with sequels of my favorite animations or comic books or Chinese TV soap operas very much in my years of elementary school. It turns out many values has been swerved totally as time goes.</p>
<p>This time I don’t want to linger this casual letter and just stopped here.
May you can enjoy your German reading.</p>
