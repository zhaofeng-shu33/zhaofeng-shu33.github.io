	<h1>Opinions towards political influence on university education</h1>
<p>2014/11/7</p>
<p>Dear professor:</p>
<p>I was in dispute with my instructor and study brother, about “whether I should join the 1-29 singing chorus rehearsal. Below is my writing to him. (I omit the beginning and revise it literally before I sent this email to you.) </p>
<p>…I just want to take this time to exhibit my opinions towards Chinese collectivism. Since it was based only on my personal idea and shallow application of two theories---Marxism and Confucianism, it is not aiming to persuade and reject you, my reverend study brother.</p>
<p>Bounded with my past feelings, I put one article called “在歌咏比赛的前一天” at the top of my QQ zone for six years and revised it several times after it was written. In this article the moral of class unity, respect for the teacher and leadership of art coordinator were relatively fully exhibited. Actually, no one can object directly to the proposition that the traditional morality combined with the time spirit is the most proper value sense that Chinese students should share. And it seemed if and only if the harmony of every such a social group is achieved that our Chinese society can become earthly paradise.</p>
<p>However, since every so-called time spirit is historical relics sooner or later and every historical value was often pointed out many defects, which contradicted with the political propaganda at that time. So our combined moral is never a perfect compound. In such a meaning every person may not obey every surplus detail forced by “such time spirit” in some cases.</p>
<p>We are always proclaiming the advance of our (political and organizational) theory, which derived from a historical product---Marxism. Using this theory, we analyze successfully all the historical and contemporary complex phenomenon except for ourselves. In such meaning, non-official association titled by Seeking Truth （清华求是学会） had some breakthrough. They criticized Chinese contemporary market-oriented economical system and all its side-effects in every domain. Although there are also torrents of criticism based on western democracy theory, which found its shaft by Foreign Language Department, I will not mention such voices since I had little knowledge and pretty strong rejection of them at my present level.</p>
<p>So at the beginning I have to overview my present attitude to the most proper value sense, which is most probably transitory and far from maturity. Our morality is never a unitary but at least combination of tradition and western theory. Such combination has its very large strength accompanied by some inner discords. For example, about how the students should behave at one university, we have quite different answers from Marxism and Confucianism. Marxism stresses that one individual can not escape from a group, in particular, mass of people. On the contrary, Confucianism stresses the importance of a small circle consisting of 同志 , who share common acceptance of 修齐治平 etc. Thus it is interesting to compare two voices at our university. What our university president said, what our  文素核心课 taught and even what we read goes like this: We should become an elegant person. Such requirement kept us at far more distance from mass of people. On the contrary, what our military training exerted, what our rigid regulations warned and what our social practice proved goes like this: We should become a responsible person for our society. Such requirement made us away from “bourgeoisie” elegance, which was irrelevant to the need of our contemporary society.</p>
<p>So a natural tendency was to coordinate this pair of contradiction. I know some students at our university managed pretty well. Such contradiction seemed to be merely the contradiction of theory and practice in the view of 毛泽东. He once said, “We should understand the laws of the objective world and become able to explain it. But more importantly, we should apply the knowledge of these laws actively to change the world”(from 《实践论》). So it seems accessible for us to achieve this goal described by Mao. However, at this point, I wonder, are they reconcilable? By saying “they”, I mean the two attitudes in the last paragraph.</p>
<p>Restricted at academic discussion, maybe every social theory can boom in this garden (THU). But if one person tries to apply two different theories to his real life simultaneously, I think it will ruin his life. I have experienced such ruin without awareness. In the last semester, our class was organizing a short trip to 北海 Park, it seemed that I would join since I had never said negative words openly. This is based on my worry about collectivism. But from the need of reading Chinese history and my naïve thought that a short message can solve all the problems, I escaped into the library just before my classmates went out of our university. I think my inconsistency is influenced by two different theories. I had to make a choice between them and I abandoned the former, if not totally, but at least never thinking in that mode. I will make it clearer about my understanding of collectivism below.</p>
<p>We all admit that earthy authority can not be as perfect as the proclaiming paradise. I think one of such inescapable defect lies at its interpretation of Marxism. It became no longer Marxism but the contemporary official ideology. In this sense, it shares little difference with traditional official ideology. Starting from its inner interest, this gigantic machine use so many rhetorical devices that we can not figure out its true purpose. If we have a little knowledge of life of Marx, we can know his storm-like attack on the autocratic government of his own motherland. As a price, Marx was expelled and could never return. In our ideology education, however, we are directed to neglect that Marx had not the sense of nationality in the traditional sense. Patriotism is appended. If we have a little knowledge of the relation between machine and human labor in capitalist society (in Marxism), we can know that workmen become appendages of the machine and they are organized like privates of the industrial army under the command of high officers. I think what just has been said can be paralleled by Chinese political management, especially at the area of education which I had experienced.</p>
<p>I wonder whether there are multi-evaluation systems in our combined official ideology. As university students there exist so many compulsory things for us to do. Even if one of them is unfinished, we can not get the final degree. However, in traditional Confucianism, even quite different persons can be regarded simultaneously as saints. We have 伯夷，who would not serve a prince whom he did not approve, but also have 柳下惠，who was not ashamed to serve an impure prince. If our society can endure persons like 伯夷, that is best demonstration of our tolerance even in the background of collectivism.</p>
<p>At last I wanted to make a short comment on 1-29. This event has already been memorized deeply in Chinese students’ mind thanks to《纪念刘和珍君》by 鲁迅, part of which requires coercive recitation in my high school. I was told many times about the patriotic symbol of 1-29 martyr especially our alumni （for example, 清华校友韦杰三）since I came here. But my last impression of this event did not lie on that but on an English novel 京华烟云, in which a tragedy happened to a family around this event because the elder daughter of the family joined this event and sacrificed. Unlike our official emphases on the evil of 北洋 government and righteous leadership of communist party in this student movement, the novel author, 林语堂，while condemning 段祺瑞 government, also considered the blame on the university part: should young students be instigated to join such political movement on the false promise of safety given by some organization?</p>
<p>So now I wonder, is there special meaning holding such massive ceremony activity? If it is only to teach Chinese citizens, especially college students, to memorize the stigma of nation, we have had enough such memorization since childhood. If it is to encourage us to study harder to make our country suffer no more in the future, then such purposes can be achieved better if we take more mathematical analysis courses (course name of my major) than joining such activity. I think the only explanation lies in its political significance. By such activity we can prove the righteous leadership of our party in the modern history of China and we can become more united around this party in the future. There is nothing wrong to do so. But there is also no essential difference between this event with the official activity such as sacrifice to heaven or ancestors in ancient China.</p>
<p>To speak objectively, the background of 1-29 is very complex, which involves many big powers in the world. I think every student at our university shares the inferior feelings towards western world even without joining any such activities. We are bound to think the fundamental problems: what we can do to change at least slightly such passive situation instinctively, since we are never separated from our cultural roots: language, traditional spirits and past experience of ourselves or our ancestors. The only difference lies in our choice of ways to achieve such unaware goal, which is already injected into our own personal dreams. Others are merely political elements, which are transitory, unreasonable sometimes and even meaningless compared to our cultural continuity.</p>
<p>Anyway, my opinions are probably too reactionary and tend to idealism, partly due to the influence of the two theories and my past experience.  I’m sorry to deny what you support. But I hope it is constructive. </p>
<p>Better destroy this email after you read or at least do not spread it.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>(end of the email)</p>
<p>To be honest, I feel lucky to have a professor like you who can inspire her students at fundamental problems. Maybe some of other professors did the same thing more subtly in their teaching process. Whether it is of current criticism, academic exploration, or historical view, they make differences in our future paths. </p>
<p>Yours</p>
