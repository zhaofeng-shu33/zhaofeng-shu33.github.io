	<h1>Thoughts about Mathematical History</h1>
<p>2014/9/13</p>
<p>You may comment that my sense of Chinese mathematics is too late after you read this email. Anyway, I write what I feel.</p>
<p>This Wednesday I attended a lecture given by an old professor of THU on pre-Christ Mathematical History. He was just the famous one giving a course called “Mathematics and Human Civilization.</p>
<p>Four oldest civilizations in the world seem to have their mathematics. But how about the level and their later development? I was the first to put forward a question to this professor after his short unorganized speech, “What should a mathematic professor do to overcome the difficulty of researching on western mathematical history?</p>
<p>Actually he hinted that he was an advanced amateur on such topics and not gave any mentions about language obstacles---when all the three professor of our department gave their opinions, I suddenly found my overlooking a simple principle of science: from simple and general to specific and difficult. First popular mathematical history books, then concentrating on one civilization, then one mathematician… finally his one original work. But I read directly a work of Greek mathematician on “Conic Curve”, whose unique thoughts tortured me until I abandoned reading.</p>
<p>So I directly went to THU global Library to borrow a first-step book and found a seat to read it from the first page. The first page treats all about world history background, like beginnings of your world history book. Without this math history book at my hand now, I can not remember any detail of Chapter one except for the author’s opinions on stages of human society (how knowledgeable he is). Then the second Chapter talked about “Oriental” mathematics, which was relative to Western mathematics.</p>
<p>According to the author and my knowledge, it was the difference between computational and practical mathematics and strict and rational science. Oriental mathematics are common property held by all the four oldest civilizations. But their achievements differ a lot. I made this judgment not only according to declaration of the author but according to his usage of total number of words. Hindu was the least and Chinese mathematics was a little more. The two civilizations are less mentioned because many original works of their civilizations are destroyed (if they existed). Unlike the stone or tablet methods of preservation of Babylonian and Egyptian mathematics, we use bamboo or paper to preserve mathematical literature, which was easy to be lost. But maybe there is another reason: relative materials on the two civilizations are less than the other two while the author can not read in our language. In the text, he said one big problem of doing research on Chinese mathematical history is far less translation. The only one literature he mentioned was The Nine Chapter on The Arithmetical Art, which he quoted indirectly. Foreigners use Wade Giles Romanization ( similar to 拼音, only used to mention the proper noun of Chinese, I cannot recognize them if without quite familiarity of this noun. This method was very common in research on Chinese History.) to mention Chinese books and authors. Because they have no sense of nationality when writing in science style, I think they are more believable than our propaganda. On one hand, we are lacking of ancient literature on mathematics, which were scoured by Chinese even including 梦溪笔谈, a relative science encyclopedia at Song Dynasty; On the other hand, we are boasting of our long , extensive and profound mathematical history, “This discovery is several hundred years than Western, that discovery..” Even if it was not boast, it was an illusion given by our mathematicians to common people: China once has great mathematics and nearly better than Western World at everything, only in the late Ming and Qing Dynasty we lagged.</p>
<p>But is that so?</p>
<p>One professor at that lecture said, “Our systematic mathematics only has very short history. You are the third generation, generally speaking. But you are the first generation to look upward at the broad sky, to think of the essence of future without worrying about political and economic restrictions of our country…”</p>
<p>A big powerful regime over a vast country with a dominating language has its inner disadvantage at science. This is my very recent opinion from history facts and present observations.</p>
<p>I quite appreciate some figures at the time of Republic China, who were the first generation to have opportunity to combine Western and Chinese Culture. But when I turned my views at science, there were so few that I can figure out within my fingers. I naturally omitted application areas, of which we have many national science prides. One important reason I think is we have no counterpart to western science and have to follow them a step if they move forward a step.</p>
<p>After the disputing period of Mao, we make so great progress at science subject. From the booming of many science competitions and other forms, institutes and increasing professionals, I can see clearly. But very recently I do not think there are essential changes at our science. Now I admitted I disliked a little Chinese science books. Just now I read one comment of the author on oriental mathematics and Greek’s: “You can not find any demonstration in the former. It was just saying, “do such, do so”, just like our science education today.”(then he praised the Greek mathematics.)</p>
<p>I was quite astonished at the regularity of the concise mathematical history book I chose by accident, footnotes, reference lists are very clear. Original name was preserved (if it was in Latin Letter, preserve directly. Give translation in English if it is of matter. If in other letter script, romanticize it.) The author apparent can read in German and French by his many usages of the two language literature. I think perhaps Cultural Multiple in Europe implemented science prosperity at such time.</p>
<p>My another thought lies at: Since there were no English translation of The famous Nine Chapters on The Arithmetical Art, why do we Chinese mathematicians try to translate it instead of putting all the minds of following Westerners? At least I have an impulse to take a try after I can improve my reading ability of literary Chinese language.</p>
<p>My above thoughts are unorganized, and much improper for your condescendence. But it was what I thought and made a try to convert from my wrong attitude and methods to major learning. If your opinions are more advanced, hope your point to my default in this quick-writing email.</p>
