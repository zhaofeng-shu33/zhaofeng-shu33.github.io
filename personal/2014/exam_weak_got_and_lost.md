# Exam week, got and lost
2014/6/24

After the sixteenth week this semester, so-called exam week began. Exams about major courses would take place this week while students were supposed to review by oneself before every exam.

All my humanity courses were ended at sixteen week and some of them were examined at that time. Shortly after the sixteenth week, I carried out my study evenly at preview, review about science courses and read about humanity books. Not every time was used efficiently, but after all it is pretty comprehensive. However, when there was only two days before the physics exam, I found no mood evenly allocating my time. A invisible force pushed myself almost spending all my study time in physics. After the physics exam, there were only two day before the mathematical analysis exam. Another invisible force pushed myself spending all my study time in preparing for it while abandoning all the other subjects. After the analysis exam, there were only two days before the advanced algebra exam...

Evolving my there exam a whole week was in this way passed, I had to say, I exerted almost all of what I know at the exam field and nearly no regret was left. Of course in every exam existed un-solved problems which I had little cover while reviewing. But it was very normal according to my understanding and study habits especially at science. But after al the three exams were gone, I wonder if there were other alternative way to go. Is it necessary that I have to review so crazily just like skeleton spirit abandoning Chinese reading?

A system may be operating well if joiners have no other business. But for me, I know no other business is never real and all I have to go on is to catch up with the long way of humanity and not to complain at such so-called leisure time.
