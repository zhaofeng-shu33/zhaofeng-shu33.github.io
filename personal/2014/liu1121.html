	<h1>To Liu</h1>
<p>2014/11/21</p>
<p>I am very sorry to neglect your email appendix which was sent to me almost three months ago. But this morning, after pursuing your thesis on “Comparison between Chinese and Western Ideas”, I was touched and began reconsidering or rearranging many immature thoughts got recently.</p>
<p>No doubt you spent countless time in collecting and reading writing materials, some of which even were not listed at the end after you found they were of little help for the topic. This thesis is not a synthesis of a certain professor but the formation of your own attitudes and this is the most difficult and rewarding.</p>
<p>Allow me to briefly recall my first thesis written in a similar way to you, I think. As I have gone “deeper” into the topic I chose, the thesis has less connection with the course itself. My topic is to discuss the literature conditions from 1949 to 1976 in new China. At first I thought it was merely a reading reaction to collections of interviews focusing on important writers. As I grew impatient to the permeating details and the underlining criticizing attitude, I desired to have a clear impression on that period of time. So I borrowed one literary history book and one literary theoretical book, focusing myself on that particular era. But I still found I was lacking the examples to form my own attitude on such topics. Then I focused on five important writers, even borrowing their biographies and read the corresponding parts in which his or her activities during 1949-1976 were narrated. Every paragraph I had written was based on a lot of reading and by that time I found my total words have far surpassed the lower limits. But I was very dissatisfied---I was still lacking of my own attitudes. After long deliberation, I decided to use the critics on research of Yu Pingbo to make a breakthrough. And I read Yu’s theoretical books on The Red Mansion, the critical thesis on Yu by two Marxian (or Maoist) young writers. And I tried to compare their different views on The Red Mansion. During the whole time, I was trying to break through the language limitation and read an English historical book on contemporary Chinese literature. And finally, to make clearly the origin of quotations in thesis by Marxian young writers, I took some efforts to locate the original place where Engels said the specific sentences. That is, I read two letters written by Engels. All above is materials which have remained in the final draft. However, I have to abandon some of what I’ve read since it had little connection with what I wanted to say. This dimension including "Teahouse" by Lao She, poems during The Great Revolution, and my failure to find a German literary book mentioned in the letters of Engels. In the final draft, most of my separating discussions of the five writers are deleted, since I think it only distract the unique example I wanted to discuss. The total words declined from 8428 to 3432.</p>
<p>Of course I spent countless time to finish all above tasks, almost covering half of my weekends in the second part of last semester. But in retrospect today, or more accurately, compared with your thesis, I think what I had written is less impressive as I though it was impressive then. I discussed a specific topic, relatively easier to maintain than your topic. And my reference lists are 4 items less than yours. But what mattered was still on ideas the thesis conveyed. What I said in my thesis was merely opposition to ideologization of literary creation and critics. But what you said is far broader and every paragraph (except the beginning and the ending) could be extended into a thesis. I made some shallow comments on your thesis and you can check the appendix to find them.</p>
<p>In retrospect, beginning a thesis preparation only with vague feelings is never the best background. I only read what I need in all the reference books I found and much time is confused on locating which parts I really need. This is like a process which allows you to produce something from nothing by reading a little. And now I despised such kind of thesis writing and thought that our adolescence should mainly be used to read what can be called “Classic”, not the barren literary era from 1949-1976. The reason that I think what you write is fundamental is nothing but a kind of writing based on “Classic”. At least I very agreed with you that what we learned at Chinese courses in middle school were very useful in such meaning. But I think standing on the basis we still need to deep our understanding on what our understanding about “Chinese Classic”, not just to exemplify something. Since I wrote a very informal criticism on my new understanding on two Chinese Classic essays, I shared it with you also contained in the appendix.</p>
<p>I have to admit my philosophical thinking is far behind you and I only covered books which had a little philosophical tendency. You can say I think too much and read too little, or what else. Anyway, I still want to arrange my thoughts about natural science during the past several days. 
One evening I had enough of our chemistry textbooks when reading equilibrium in acid-base water solutions. I thought it only told readers “do such, do so” with piles of computation problems. I took some efforts to find an English textbook on the similar level, or more precisely, a lower level since the English textbook does not surmise that we’ve learned chemistry in middle school. Actually I had little gain even when I spent much time reading it. But at least at one point I was touched---what is atom theory?</p>
<p>Chinese students are never sensitive to the question since we are only sensitive to formulas, which can help us get a high score in general science courses.</p>
<p>In my present understanding, atom theory is historical, related to a developing process and every process is brought by a genius, whose name we should never forget.</p>
<p>So we have a list, starting from Dalton, then Thomson, Rutherford, Bohr…</p>
<p>You may think, “I know such list from middle school chemistry textbooks. I merely do not connect this list with the atom theory.”</p>
<p>On mentioning atom theory, we are instinctively to utter its postulations, and we (general science students) even can not distinguish it from kinetic molecular theory. It seemed that in our potential conscientiousness we hold too many postulations in science as absolute truth even if we do not speak out in such way. We totally neglect that scientific development happens only in the recent hundred years and modern chemistry, in particular, began from Dalton in 1803.</p>
<p>I tried to re-understanding why the introduction of the concept "mole", is essential from the English textbook. It does not disappoint me to some extent. mole is never an invention made by a mathematical genius like Galois, while it appears to make further chemistry research more convenient. The story before “mole” occupied 5 pages of the textbook. It began with the “wrong” scale of Dalton on relative atomic masses. Then Gay-Lussac’s Law based on experiments, then Avogardro’s Hypothesis based on Gay-Lussac’s experiments, then Cannizzaro’s methods, and then we have the mole concept based on the famous “Carbon-12 Scale”. The most interesting thing is that at beginning chemists got the relative atomic mass from molecular masses (by Cannizzaro’s wonderful methods). There are actually many inversions when we are introduced images of modern science. If you allow me to talk abstract algebra as an example, this sub-branch is very typical and even extreme.
Our professor and modern textbooks all say that historically abstract algebra started from research on transformation group and rational solutions of polynomial equations. But we have to begin this course very abstractly and learn many concepts and theorems which will be quickly forgotten by us after exams. It is similar to language learning I think, after you learn it and you put it away, then how many can you remember and what is the meaning of learning?</p>
<p>Analogies beyond science are non-scientific, I know. But I have put forward of a fundamental question I am very interested in at the very end of the last paragraph. Maybe thanks to philosophy, we can synthesize many many things and spiritually freed from technical trainings in science and language learning. Some people think philosophy talked too abstractly and far away from reality. I do not think so. We have already twenty years behind --- twenty years direct experiences in the world and we have made countless human-made scientific or language practices. That is enough for us to synthesize if we can find proper trigger, I think. Should we continue to practice without philosophical consciousness?</p>
<p>Yes, sometimes it is difficult to have a little gain when facing a book of "Classic", but it is technical problem if we are ardent enough to do so. (I think seeking help of Humanity and Foreign Language Department seems inevitable...)</p>
<p>At the several preceding paragraphs I don’t talk in detail and you may find your starting point of philosophy is very different from mine (Classic sense, now I only cover Mencius strictly speaking). Hope to arrange in detail my philosophical views on details next time.</p>
