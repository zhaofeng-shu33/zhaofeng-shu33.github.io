	<h1>Evaluation of Literature</h1>
<p>2014/8/14</p>
<p>I will shorten my email as short as possible
If you have no interest in my following short extemporaneous literature review, you can skip it and read my feelings towards mathematics and physics directly.</p>
<h2>About the evaluation of literature</h2>
<p>While most graduates think education brought them much benefit, a great English female writer, Virginia Woolf said as follows:</p>
<p>All this pitting of sex against sex, of quality against quality; all this claiming of superiority and imputing of inferiority belong to the private-school stage of human existence where there are ‘sides’, and it is necessary for one side to beat another side, and of the utmost importance to walk up to a platform and receive from the hands of the Headmaster himself a highly ornamental pot. As people mature they cease to believe in sides or in Headmasters or in highly ornamental pots.</p>
<p>I understand the above mentioned passage as follows:</p>
<p>In our school education, we learned there are sides including “1 study gods, study goodness, 2 good-grade students, 3 bad-grade students…” Thus there are superiority side and inferiority side. We are pushed to crowd into the former side. One proof of it was to receive rewards from headmasters. But as people leave school, they gradually find it of little importance whether a person once received rewards from headmaster.</p>
<p>Virginia Woolf thought there was no single and perpetual standard to evaluate a student. It was only an analogy to evaluation of current literature works. She thought, for women writers, it was “the most servile attitude to submit to the measurement”, a very fantastic opinion follows (to advise women writers):</p>
<p>So long as you write what you wish to write, that is all that matters; and whether it matters for ages or only for hours, nobody can say. But to sacrifice a hair of the head of your vision, a shade of its colour, in deference to some Headmaster with a silver pot in his hand or to some professor with a measuring-rod up his sleeve, is the most abject treachery, and the sacrifice of wealth and chastity which used to be said to be the greatest of human disasters, a mere flea-bite in comparison.</p>
<p>Probably I was in a passion to apply for Second major at English literature and passed the interview. But now as summer vacation passed two thirds, I rechecked my plans and fulfillments. I mainly keep an account of what I disordered as below:</p>
<p>I feel more and more passive at the preview of differential equations and University Physics, both of which I found great difficulty at. For the former, I nearly lost all interest at the deep theory bearing the characteristic (mathematical) analysis. But for the latter, I can tell honestly I can not understand core concepts such as the statistics methods and relative theory, which was used separately in quantum mechanics and electromagnetics. Another problem comes from the conception of wave, which makes me suffer a lot at theory of light and wave-particle duality. When my preview degenerates into a fulfillment of reading and working out answers to problems, I found little meaning at all. </p>
<p>Sometimes I also feel bewildered between relations of preview and review. Forgetting fresh-year textbooks is one thing, but maybe I have little patient for my review. Recently the time allocated to review is very limited…
Another problem is the disordered timetable. I find I can not get up as early as in university. And I often feel sleepy in the morning after breakfast. 
Patient is a most essential thing I find I lacked. Many evenings before were spent typing English articles to show off to others what I learned in the half year. But I do not think it more meaningful than reading some English literature works. Only recently I forced myself to come back to literature at evening and stop typing inaccurate English articles. But today I cannot resist jumping from timetable and writing to you in a disordered language. Maybe you can just read it and forget it, or you can type some feelings toward physics or anything.</p>
