# Choices influenced by environment
Unknown time during 2014

I feel sorry not to reply your email in time. After knowing your social attitude, I find much more for myself to improve. Connected with my recent reading and hearing experience, I plan to open a new topic, about choices determined by large environment.

The military training has been a memory for me. During which time, I cannot understand the behavior of enlisting as undergraduates. I take it for granted that the intellectual have more meaningful work than throwing pens. Bur now I will reduce my prejudice in consideration of large environment. In senior three, I once put the motto of J.K Rowing to a supreme status. She thought writing novels is the only arena she truly belonged to. I desperately agree to her pursuit of her truly belonged dream while not neglecting people by charity. Many encouragers declares with definite certainty that one can achieve his dream on condition that… But there is one case in which we must take for consideration, and the result of its consideration determined the destiny of many lives.

If there were no peace, if there were no clear politics, things would be different. Recently I caught a glimpse of the collision between Donglin movement (東林黨) and eunuch (閹黨). It was absurd to call a group of people in feudal era “eunuch party”, and surprised at their political energy. The conflicts are set at the tail of Ming Dynasty. Though I cannot give any class analysis, I do think this kind of politic tumult has staged on the arena for countless times. As Mencius said, "I have not heard of one who bent himself, and at the same time made others straight"(吾未聞枉已而能正人者也); let alone to hold justice in the state. When such “ambitious monster” come to power, what affects will be brought on aspects of society?

The Confucian intellectuals regards integrity as the most important. Smelling the disgusting smoke in the court, the file of intellectuals began to split up. A few directly made assault on the captain of eunuchs, and was tortured to shocking death. Many remained silent and showed their loyalty by building ancestral hall for the “nine thousand years”. And some became executioners killing
“not myself” for the second sovereign.

This is the time when a country has strayed from its normal track of running. It happens occasionally, from what Northern warlords did in the early 20ths century and what “Gang of Four” damages in the late 20ths century. What is in the middle of the two accidents, a war which is the most violent and devastating in China’s history.

Can I compare the condition of human body to our China? She produces some dissident components sometimes and can cure herself at some price. But as a result of her poor health, external virus finds chance to raid. The virus is cruel, he tortures not only protecting cells but thousands of innocent cells to die. On such severe condition, two choices are put before the adolescents, before every Chinese? Enlist? To guerrilla forces or to regular army? Exile? To inland or overboard? Surrender? Be conquered people or objectionable traitors? 

When a natural disaster or human neglects made people, regardless personality, perished; When an illness from either outside or inside happens; Even when family has mishaps; we are evolved to a dilemma, the hardest dilemma, not resulting from original dream dimming but from storms rushing on it. Is this case possible? All those seeming impossible might one day become possible.

Half a year before, I was a little bewildered at the dragon-like sites of enrolling for clubs at our campus. I aspire for Chinese Ancient, those integrity of philosophers and politicians in Chinese history. There are voices advocating reviving of Chinese ancient philosophy, talking and using as ingredients Chinese ancient history. There are also voices diminishing the Chinese feudal creativity, neglecting the discipline of ancient society.

Though time changes, so many principles remains. People have to eat to live. Many strive for power and better social status. External threats never disappear for China. We can find traces of all in annals. Once faced with hunger, running away, or any other significant affects, what we should do next will be much affected. The first concerned is no more personal affair, but nation responsibility.
