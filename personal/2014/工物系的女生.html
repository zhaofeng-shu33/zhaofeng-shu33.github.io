	<h1>工物系的女生</h1>
<p>2014/5/25</p>
<p>She was from the Project Physics Department, fresh female student.
Tonight I happened to sit opposite her. I found she was writing (I thought at that moment) diary. So I could not resist going to look at it while she was away.</p>
<p>About her plan in this summer, she was going to assist teaching in some place. She wants to practice her English and learn to cooperate with others. </p>
<p>She talks about the superior status of Tsinghua and Peking University, at which students have many privileges that other students from other universities do not have.</p>
<p>She hints the odd air in Tsinghua University. Students are indulged to behave not so well to match with the privileges they have.</p>
<p>Some coolness prevailed in our campus. The club activities and
colorful art activities can never cover the rush towards self interest.</p>
<p>I was touched by the three paragraphs. But at that time, a man came in and I mistook it as the owner of the diary. But as I prepared to look again, she actually came back. I fast returned to my seat.</p>
<p>During the interval at which she went out to get a phone, I wrote a note to apologize for it. And she gave me a message back, which left an simple but powerful sentence:</p>
<p>年轻时尚可实话实说，有胸怀有抱负，不然以后老了就要受各种约束。</p>
<p>我也怕大学的安逸生活让我忘记前进的方向，故作此以自勉。</p>
