Do you feel surprised to receive such an email from free wind, who kept English diary and treated you as his reader during Senior Three? Now he is eager to know something from you, how’s it going?

He remembered clearly the appointment made by you and him at one P.E. class---Meet ten years from then and talk still about feelings towards English language or English literature. Now more than two years has gone. Do you still remember?

Only one month ago in his class, he made a presentation titled “Find the place where my favorite English writer lived”. The person was not nobody expect author of Jane Eyre---Charlotte Bronte. This book was kept in his mind as his first perusing English novel, was continuously used during the last four months. In order to make this email contains some contents, I will write an extemporaneous review about several chapters of Oliver Twist, which I recently read every night.(You can skip it to the ending of the email directly if you feel hard to understand.)

This miserable boy was confined after he asked for more porridge in our text of Senior Two English textbook. Then he was sold to a undertaker ( who prepared coffin and related matters for burying someone). He was still ill-treated in the undertaker’s shop, by a charity boy Noah and his allies, Charlotte (I thought her as a trusted maid, who were fond of Noah. But the author did not say these.) Besides the maltreat in shop, he was brought to funeral spots many times for preparing to be a useful apprentice. An incident of death and burial was depicted in detail in Chapter 5. I thought it was a good chance to know the conditions of poor people in England at that time.
Though I have some confusions about conversations between the beadle (I thought he was a parish minor official.) and Mr. Sowerberry, owner of the coffin shop, it was most typical of Dickens’ writing (full of exaggeration and figurative language) for the part of description of dirty and miserable conditions of poor people. I quoted from the original text a few sentence to share with you:

The houses were tenanted by people of the poorest class: as their neglected appearance would have sufficiently denoted, without the concurrent testimony afforded by the squalid looks of the few men and women who, with fold arms and bodies half doubled, occasionally skulked along.

(Words) squalid, dirty and unpleasant; skulk, move with guilt.

With fold arms… means that if the people folded their arms, then their bodies would be doubled.

This sentence is a portrait of poor people.

See another sentence:

…But even these crazy dens (houses) seemed to have been selected as the nightly haunts of some houseless wretches (poor homeless people), for many of the rough boards which supplied the place of door and window, were wrenched (pull) from their positions, to afford an aperture (an opening hole) wide enough for the passage (pass) of a human body.

This sentence means that the door (or the window, both are without cover) was open enough to let a person go through. Thus their living condition can be imagined.

Oliver and his master, Mr. Sowerberry went to the “house” at which a woman died recently. The woman’s husband was in deep sorrow and let nobody near the corpse of his wife. But the master (his identity is undertaker) had to measure the size to make the proper coffin. So the man said to the undertaker in furry and sorrow like following:

“I tell you I won’t have her put into the ground. She couldn’t rest there. The worms would worry her---not eat her—she is so worn away.” (Conversation in novel used simple English, natural and efficient to convey strong feeling.)

…”I say she was starved to death. I never knew how bad she was, till the fever came upon her; and then her bones were starting through the skin. There was neither fire nor candle; she died in the dark—in the dark! She couldn’t even see her children’s faces, though we heard her gasping (say) out their names. I begged for her in the streets: and they sent me to prison. When I came back, she was dying; and all the blood in my heart has dried up, for they starved her to death…”

I quoted almost all the miserable husband said. It was unorganized but out of heart. The following tranquil narrative was little to notice compared to such a climax (I think it was).

Even when we stopped reading, the huge gap between people still left in our mind. There are Some like the beadle in the novel, who can order others and live a comfortable life, and others like the poor husband in this chapter, who can do nothing but see her dear wife dying with his own eyes. This question is conveyed to reader by Dickens, who also can not solve it within his age.

At this point I didn’t want to talk about such big social problems, to which every philosophy theory has its answer. But such questions matter because they make of the answer to “Why we read Literature”. 



You might feel at difficulty at understanding my writing above. But that was very normal since you learned it as second foreign language. Perhaps you have something to share about your major, though I know nothing about Korean language.

Looking forward to your reply,

Your free wind
