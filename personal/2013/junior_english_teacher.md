My schoolmates are too busy to reply to my emails, so I cherish this reply a lot when I look through it.

You say you are behaving yourselves as your life and work need.

Perhaps you went through so much disappointment in your twenties which kept you from your original ideal. But I think there is still something that one can adjust. One of them is about reading.

The reason why I mentioned English reading is that I started this route from Senior two. Looking back at those experiences, I feel both worthiness and confusion. I don't include reading chicken soup as reading English books, though I carefully read these short articles.

I meant some books such as The story of life, by Helen Killer; Jane Eyre which is one of the most well-known classical works;The Gay Genius: The life and times of Su Dongpo, by Li Yutang who was once nominated for the Nobel Prize. The three books are all that I got through. I have to admit that almost half of my attention was put on the strange words, about a quarter was put on the external meaning of the sentences. The continuation of reading process is scattered into pieces. But I also have gains. I know some English words which seldom appear in other forms except in printed books. I feel I am building solid foundations to get close to another form of truths.
