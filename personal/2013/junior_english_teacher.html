	<h1>Junior English teacher</h1>
<p>2013/7/16</p>
<p>My schoolmates are too busy to reply to my emails, so I cherish this reply a lot when I look through it.</p>
<p>You say you are behaving yourselves as your life and work need.</p>
<p>Perhaps you went through so much disappointment in your twenties which kept you from your original ideal. But I think there is still something that one can adjust. One of them is about reading.</p>
<p>The reason why I mentioned English reading is that I started this route from Senior two. Looking back at those experiences, I feel both worthiness and confusion. I don't include reading chicken soup as reading English books, though I carefully read these short articles.</p>
<p>I meant some books such as The story of life, by Helen Killer; Jane Eyre which is one of the most well-known classical works;The Gay Genius: The life and times of Su Dongpo, by Li Yutang who was once nominated for the Nobel Prize. The three books are all that I got through. I have to admit that almost half of my attention was put on the strange words, about a quarter was put on the external meaning of the sentences. The continuation of reading process is scattered into pieces. But I also have gains. I know some English words which seldom appear in other forms except in printed books. I feel I am building solid foundations to get close to another form of truths.</p>
