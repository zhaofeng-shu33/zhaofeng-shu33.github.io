	<h1>当学委失职的深层原因</h1>
<p>2013/10/12</p>
<p>The deep problem lies in my inexperience in organizing such an activity and the character defect that I tend to surround myself. I am very sorry that I said I was quite experienced and I could surely perform my duty well. But the fact is that I was pretty processing in steps in my own thoughts and making a series of disappointing mistakes. They are 1 having not read the announcement in web learning; 2 determined to change the topic with other group without communicating with our classmates. 3 neglecting you both tonight and numerous items.</p>
<p>In one way, I think, due to my serious negligence of duty, our class should assign another more capable person assuming the position I now work at. This is very urgent in order not to exert more negative affects on the work of our class. In another way, I must oblige myself to make self-examination. If I can retain the position due to special reasons, I think in this activity both of you are expected to become pioneers and I can run errands for you two.</p>
<p>Even if you two still have another trust in me out of tolerance, at least every resolution on this activity cannot be determined by one person of our class.</p>
<p>In the past, I think making resolutions decisively is efficient but in recent practice I find this method causes much more trouble. Not every fault can we have opportunity to amend. I at least hope that you can have an efficient study process if you went to the library of art.</p>
