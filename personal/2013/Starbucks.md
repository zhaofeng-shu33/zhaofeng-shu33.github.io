Across the board 通用

Starbucks is a well-known company selling coffee around the world. This
tape tells something about the company first and then involves an boardroom
master class which was given by the CEO of Starbucks.

I sent you both the normal speed tape and the slow speed's. You can try
the latter at the beginning.

I put the whole passage down in my notebook in a way that I listened
half sentence and pause the tape, writing......

Now I want to make some outline of the tape:

The questioner is similar to a host, I think, while the CEO, as a guest, answered the two questions.

The first question is about modifications. But the guest seemingly didn't
answer the question. He talked about the development of the company is
not by advertisement, but by concentrating on people including both staff
and customers. Besides, he emphasized the importance of earning success.
But in the last of the answer, he mentioned the core business rules. I
think that his company preserved the rules while trying to adjust to the
outside world. So he said "there is a real balance here". I think radical
modifications or minor change of the Starbucks model are both improper
when it comes to the real situation. The reality is complicated enough to
simply say yes or no to the question of change.

The second question is about the golden business rules. His direct answer
is 100% authentic true. Next he mentioned you needn't pretend to know
everything. There are always people around you who are better than you in
one area or another. You have to do is sharing and cooperating with
them. I think the guest talked about many points in both two
answers. It's easy to say these truths than done. His answer is a little
unstructured I think, but they are his experiences that can't be
understood by listeners in a short time.

I think the listens can't snatch useful things unless they listened
many times.
