	<p>﻿# Situation Noon
2016/9/21</p>
<p>This will be the final and critical afternoon for my future. The choice of whether rejecting being admitted into Department of Mathematics for graduate study must be made before the result of whether I am admitted by Department of Electronics.</p>
<p>Only one and a half hours ago, I have decided to accept being admitted by Department of Mathematics because I am not sure whether I will be admitted by Department of Electronics. But a phone call by Professor 沈 from Department of Electronics changed the situation totally. He told me that I can be admitted by Professor 张, who led the Cyber Physical Information System lab in 深圳 while another student from Department of Electronics who also apply for Professor 张 will be rejected. But still I am not sure whether thie promice will work out regardless of my ranking in the comprehensive interview. From Professor 沈's tone it seems that the ranking in the interview is not important. But from what I am told yesterday by the assistant of 教务 von Department of Electronics the ranking is critical because of the limiting number of enrollment.</p>
<p>As a result, it is still possible that I will lose both the admission if I reject my Department. Then I had to prepare for national graduate exam. </p>
