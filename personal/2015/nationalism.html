	<h1>over the view of nationalism</h1>
<p>2015/3/5</p>
<p>But over the view of nationalism, “Necessity of Sinicizing Marxism” is only limited to one aspect of the circulation of western ideas in modern China. Magnifying this aspect and neglecting all of the others are typically the task of political courses. I skipped the latter part of the first course and went directly to library, where I happened to find a selected work of 严复. In our orthodox middle school textbook, this great thinker had only one chance to be remembered by us---through his translation of work of Darwin. But in reality, he studied Confucianism in childhood and stuck to it the whole life. But in his adolescence, he studied a branch of western technology---轮船. Then he went to the Great Britain, where he met 郭嵩焘，who was a diplomat at that time. Both of them observed British society carefully and had much better understanding than their companions at home over the question called “世变之亟”. I only read one essay of Yan over this issue but I can already feel his concern. “尝谓中西之事理，其最不同而断乎不可合者，莫大于中之人好古而忽今，西之人力今以胜古，中之人以一治一乱，一盛一衰为天行人事之自然，西之人以日进无疆既胜不可复衰，既治不可复乱为学术政化之极，则盖我中国圣人之意…</p>
<p>In his mind, he still can not abandon the view of existence of saint, and even tried to put new ability of predicting into Chinese ancient saints. But he had already to criticize those scholars who are泥古不化. In his view, he signed at the fact that our saints do not put science as one aspect of study material. But he explained the 苦衷 of saints for doing so. He explained that our China was surely to develop in his own step if there were not attack made by western countries. And everything would be really peaceful even without science and technology. But at this time, since we have already been put into the changeable world, we have no reason to resist the advanced things developed by others. I think he expressed such meanings.</p>
<p>Write here, by the way I took down some attitudes in learning science, although it had little to do with social issues. I took organic chemistry course this morning and I thought the professor was very honest to say, “it was true this course would be pretty “boring”, but how can you really learn something if it was too ‘colorful’.” In his view, science is really a kind of real knowledge, which will make your life full instead of empty when you learn a foreign language or political courses or any too general courses.</p>
<p>Since both you and I have too many things to do during this semester, do not bother to reply emails unless you really want to say something. </p>
