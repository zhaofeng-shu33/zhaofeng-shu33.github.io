	<h1>A letter to Professor Sun</h1>
<p>2015/2/7</p>
<p>Miss Sun,</p>
<p>Once you wondered why most of your colleagues will not speak out of the truth, the truth about the influence of political ideology on the research of humanity discipline? I found similar cases at the end of Chapter Two of a novel “1984”.</p>
<p>But at least, as members of intellectuals, there had been countless limits set against us. You say you are researching on Lu Xun, but on which aspects of him? Lu is not merely a literary figure in the modern history of China. He is deeply involved in political, cultural and social movements happening in his times and his thoughts had great influence on several generations later on. I thought it was very difficult for researchers to restore the accurate Lu Xun in historical background on account of lack (or shortage) of knowledge and feelings of Lu’s political and social thoughts. The norm of modern research taught us to learn many abstract theories first, which was of course right. Then we should apply these theories to research on the object we chose, thus making our research easily recognized among colleagues who shared the similar advanced educational background with us. The second step is also totally right, but wiping out the uniqueness of the object—Lu Xun.
I don’t know much about of him, only having two hearsays to share with you. People with different ideological views eyed him fundamentally different. One study brother from Seeking Truth Association once said he read almost the collective works of Lu in his Senior and he inherited the critical modes of the great fighter. At least he, majoring in Art History, accepted the artistic thoughts of Lu. Another study brother from Western Foothill Association once made obscure criticism on the “gentile” of Confucianism, “who could do nothing but attack on our traditional heritage”. At least he, an expert in traditional etiquette culture, totally disagree with all the sarcasm Lu targeted on the so called feudal cultural system.</p>
<p>Luckily these two voices didn’t meet each other. We know people gather with similar ones and while you are in the foreign language department, consensuses on the basic views and methodologies should be accepted, otherwise you will feel lonely and isolated---just like Winston in the novel 1884.</p>
<p>Teacher Sun, you must think I am very impolite to say something directly using the second person. But in the very end of this short email, I claimed the word “you” in the preceding paragraphs can be targeted to whoever confronted with similar dilemmas including myself, thought the examples and arguments need modifying.     </p>
