	<h1>Critic on four personal diaries from Qzone</h1>
<p>2015/7/3</p>
<p>A tells his watch reactions to popular documentary chips. </p>
<p>B wrote an essay called “life”, showing her thinking trajectory on life attitude. And after CEE, she wrote a long essay to memorialize just past senior year.</p>
<p>C at the end of one year, wrote an essay, in which he recollects the last semester of Senior Three and the first semester at university.</p>
<p>D Before the eve of Girl’s Day, wrote a long essay, in which he reflected his multiple interests were contradicted with the requirement at Mathematical Department.</p>
<p>These diaries were all written by a certain age period, around twenty years old, with the same identity called University Student. The difference may lie at the fact that they have distinct characteristics and write down different aspects of personal life. But the common points can also be found among these diaries. It should be noted such analysis is hastily conducted without the ability to enlarge the research scope. What can I choose is merely from peers I know, and most of them do not leave articles on Qzone. Some of them set the obstacles for outsiders to enter their private zone. Thus, these few articles I read are rare materials and I can only assume that they are typical and can share some lights on knowing the contemporary University Student. I once read that the newly booming e-private space—blog or other substitutes, to some extent becomes diaries written (mostly by teenagers) for others---mostly friends. Such a new cultural phenomenon deserves attention, for it provides excellent research materials to know this group of people. Since articles on e-private space are written by the informants themselves, they are direct transmitting some kinds of emotions. By drawing these emotions from the events written and analyzing them combined with the social environment this group of people is emerged in, we can reach some inspiring conclusions, instead of using general type-classification, which is too misty and misleading.</p>
<p>Before dealing with some details with these diaries, some different kinds of epistemology should be mentioned. One is personal history approach, in which grand narrative takes place by telling stories of microcosmic personal affairs. The storyteller is often telling his own story, centered around himself, thus bearing individual subjectivity. However, because storyteller often recollect past events and rearrange them based on his current situations, it can never be said that their narratives reflect their past with high accuracy. On the other hand, the purpose of paying some attention to personal history is not to create new standing points in the research of history. It is merely another approach to demonstrate the basic ideas of historical research. That is, personal history is used to indicate the large historical picture. In this meaning, by dealing with details of some university students (typical troops of the educated), some characteristics of Chinese educational ecology can be indicated, and even the social cultural trend is hinted very indirectly. For example, the situation of D has indirect link with the reviving humanity fever among middle-class of mainland. The narrative of “A” shows that new media became an important way to link common people with general social problems. B and C seem to tell very individual stories, for they use countless proper nouns to show their care on the concrete matters. (It is very interesting to measure the degree of concrete and degree of universality in one’s narrative. One extreme is that the narrative is very void, only with general life attitude. Then some narratives will show the thinking path like B in “life”. Then there are narratives which tell the general situations of the narrator but do not go into details of concrete matters. Such mode shows at least the narrator do not take into concern the concrete form but take care of philosophical situations of himself. At last is memorial essays written by B and C. But even the seeming concrete writing of B and C, it indeed showed the universal topic, concerned with every human being. That is about shared memory, youth friends and even the missing of hometown induced by geographical separation. Literati will decorate their language well to express similar meanings, but it can be argued that the untrimmed words by B and C are nearer to original feelings.</p>
<p>In the above, the approach to personal history is discussed. It is emphasized that its purpose is centered on macroscopic picture and the microscopic representation is trivial. And it can be added that extremely self-centered representation should be classified into discussion of other disciplines, such as existential philosophy.</p>
<p>Another totally different approach is from Communication. It takes the media into care. Thus, the Qzone itself will be considered and compared with other kinds of media. By analysis of the media, Communication can diverse into discussion of personal relationships, private power and the free development of individual. Here, analysis along this path is omitted. </p>
