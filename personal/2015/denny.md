You sent me a short message through e-mail, complaining my incomprehension of the importance of social communication. Your interpretation of current society is very plausible. It is not a time to produce “thinker” in either the Axial Age or hundreds of years after Renaissance in Europe. One vital hindrance (even regardless of time requirement) is the specialization of intellectuals. Yesterday one of our department leaders gave a thought-provoking speech, prohibiting us from imbuing too much time on major-irrelevant things. He summarizes the characteristics of current society in two concise sentences: To success you must own major-license, — that is publishing thesis on internationally famous journals. Secondly, Matthew effect, which means your words count in various fields even if you are not an expert in them, as long as you become top-intellectuals in one field. He admitted the rule of society is sometimes cruelly applied on each individual. Some “folk mathematicians” once asked his help in justifying the academic value of their products. And they were all rejected cruelly without any exemption. This kind of phenomenon proved the iron law of current society, especially among academic fields. In conclusion, you have no right to say three or tell four in one field unless you get the “license”. If you violate this iron law, no one will listen to your nonsense and more badly, no intellectuals will sympathize with you (though the media probably will use you to attract eyes of more people).

At this point, I think of one famous old student in our university, who was once introduced ceremoniously by “清新时报”. Roughly speaking, he was not intelligent enough so that he passed many years studying for exams. At last, our college leader was moved by his persistence and allowed him to become an auditor in our college. It was reported that he studied very hard and listened to various courses of multiple disciplines (maybe just like me in the past year). On the surface, people surround him pay high respect to his spirit. But at least the speaker (yesterday) of my department will never agree with such “waste of mind”. And the same thing can be paralleled on my head. And it seemed to produce two serious results for me: (1) my mathematical grounds are not solid enough; (2) I gradually lost the gold time and the willing to discuss mathematical questions with peers on equal level.

There was a terminology called “path dependence”, which means you (man) tend to do things as you do in the past (for example, your unusual silence at English listening class). And to break such dependence is both hard and painful. And honestly speaking, I have not made any positive attempt to solve problems (1) and (2) because I still rely heavily on what I did before (for example, I can not resist writing something to others.)

For some outsiders, it is indeed absurd to make yourself exhausted in things unrelated to your major. In their views, the specialty is quite beneficial: you only need to learn one skill and then you can enjoy millions of products brought about by others. If you spend more time on familiarizing with this skill you chose to learn two years ago, you can have more space of choice among these millions of products in the future. And if you spend a little more time enlarging your friends circle, and know their specialty, then you can ask their help without knowing the interior mechanism of the fulfillment of your tough matters. These three points are quite persuasive even we neglect the sensational factor. Another mortal attack on my type is that you can not spread your combination of knowledge to others since you lack of the communication skills. Thus, unless you collaborate with prominent figures in students' union, you can never make effective propaganda. But sadly, such collaboration is a small probability event.

At this point, I am unable to retort the above opinions. And since midnight is approaching, I will finish this short essay here. But I will append another essay to show my shallow attempt to combine knowledge: “One type of computer game”.
