	<h1>To Denny</h1>
<p>2015/6/1</p>
<p>Hello, Denny. I have to admit that I am too impatient to write down my thoughts in the past few days. Before the daily approaching course selection the major branch orientation, the speed of my thinking and collected knowledge accumulates rapidly in only the past few days.</p>
<p>Tonight when I submitted coursework of Probability at the doorway of my department, I casually looked at those posters tapped on the movable board. Most are summer camp information. Indeed, top institutes try to attract outstanding intellectuals by this chance. Except for those regular pathways along the major branch, it seems two kinds of so-called opportunities are possible. One is along mathematical finance and the other is what I mentioned in the last email—mathematical biology. On those posters, I find that 复旦 University is going to hold a summer camp of life science and hands out olive branches to related majors, among which mathematics and physics are most popular. Another poster gives information of Peking University, in which a short-timed mathematical biology courses will be given and undergraduates are invited. All those posters seem attracting to me if I take the financial factors (these short-time activities are almost free-of-charge) into account. Indeed, after quitting the minor of English, I hesitate between going aboard and staying inboard. Two factors contribute to my reconsideration a lot. One is listening ability, in which I find great difficulty in both first or second foreign language. The other is financial support.</p>
<p>However, on second thoughts, attracting posters illustrate nothing but my illusion towards an unknown field. Indeed, I have isolated from any course of biology for almost two years and my level is still restricted to secondary education of biology, and degenerates a lot inevitably as time goes on. It seems targeting at major course of life science is also inevitable for me in the next semester, but what contribute to my present ardent attitude towards this booming science and what is the possible crisis and limitations behind such attitude?</p>
<p>Of course anything can be traced to childhood, but there is a big difference. Children like watching animals, for me they are most in colorful pictures. So-called biological diversity makes the world interesting, also contributing to a gigantic system of nomenclature. This is a more complex nomenclature than those in astronomy and chemistry. All these systems of nomenclature are highly artificial and in the view of our departments, they are indeed not science but objects of research and we can never lower our eyesight so much to research on any concrete objects of them. However, without these concrete researches on either a star, or a class of organic compound, how can we know the general rules governing among all of them? Another inevitable fact is that scientists have to use some special objects to investigate on others. You must remember the status of fruit flies in Genetics, and there are many common used organic solvents in laboratory. We remember these names so deeply not because they have the status of fundamental theorem, but because of their frequent use---and if we do not use them, we cannot find better substituent in short times.</p>
<p>In the morning after the class of Probability, one study God communicated with the professor about problems in quantum field theory. It seems very deep theories of Probability interrelates this physical branch. And at the very end of their discussion, the criticism on “people in Physical Department” is inevitable, “they do not know mathematics, and casually make out of something. Thus they cannot go further.” Interesting, in another occasion, I also heard criticism on “students in Mathematical Department”, “they only know how to prove something, but they are idiots in how to calculate, especially ignorant of analytic solutions to problem.” This happens after a discussion of one complex function questions, and it seems complex analysis professor taught us impractical and inefficient methods on calculation, so that students from external departments are unsatisfactory. However, beyond the region of both mathematics and physics, the criticism or so-called condescending mind state is prevalent. I happened to find one interesting essay in Humanity Library discussing this problem. In this essay, it points out that “central questions in philosophy of science, such as the distinctive features of science from other endeavours, have been traditionally addressed in terms of what is considered to be the paradigm science: physics.” I think not only philosophical problems, but the narrative of science history is dominated by the development of history. Such view point comes naturally from “Reductionism”（还原论）.One successful application of physicists is their claim that “chemistry is reducible to quantum mechanics. And “Interesting, I find one small evidence in such reduction...</p>
