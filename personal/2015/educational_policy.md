## 论教育决策

Since I am concentrating on general principle of education, (notice such area is different from personal opinion on current education and imagination about ideal education.), what I learned from Behavioral Social Science provided me a good norm to apply its principles to what happened around me on the area of education. I will not systematically show the principles, with the only intention of analyzing some examples。

Example 1

Grouping policy.

You must experience countless situation in class in which the teacher needed students to feedback their choices. Grouping is only one of such choices. A very coarse methods are finished by immediate communications between the teacher and active students, when determining the teaching materials in extra tutorial courses, for example. However, this method seems low-efficient, since linear oral language communication can never show the willing of the whole class and takes up too much in-class time. Then we have a powerful supplement with the help of questionnaire. This questionnaire choice is directly related to profits of each student and thus will be seriously treated. To make things more complex or better conducted, the choices will be ranked, first, second and even third. In Chinese it is called, in each choice we can determine whether it is 第一志愿，第二 or 第三志愿。The term from CEE is borrowed and used on such small choice and has many other applications.
