In this article, two topics are explored. One is the role of female teacher assistant. The other is the behavior of teacher assistants (助教表现). My motivation is from my own experiences in different college courses. And maybe such reflection can help us in the future if we choose this path to help us financially. 
My writing style is heavily influenced by social science. Personal opinions are restrained as much as possible (in fact, my opinions will only serve as trivial reference).</p>
