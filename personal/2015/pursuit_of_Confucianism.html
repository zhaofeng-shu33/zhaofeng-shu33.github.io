	<h1>On the final pursuit of Confucianism</h1>
<p>2015/4/10</p>
<p>Some religious people insist on the power of divinity and the prophecy of it. In their views, modern science is nothing. Before now I hold firmly their absurdity. But it seems suddenly the same thing happens to me. By saying this I mean a totally new pursuit emerges vividly onto my mind. This is a totally distinct pursuit and very probably contradicted to personal science pursuit. It starts from my personal inclusion of “Confucianism”. Though I use this word, I never mean I stick to the dogma of it. Most of the materials are “out of time” or more precisely, need new interpretation. But anyway I can never suffer the fossil destiny of these heritages. It is absolutely true that there have been at least three different Confucian streams emerging gradually onto current Chinese society. One is in the area of politics, which I knew very little. The second permeates into bookstores—they became one cultural simultaneously commercial ingredient among many other competitors. The third is most related to my daily life—it is rooted in academic environment. And every week there will be dozens of new books about Confucianism transported into Humanity Library, more than Marxism, (probably because of the percentage of history, one should notice that Marxism has no more than 170 years. Even if researchers describe in great detail of these 170 years, I conjecture the total amount is still less than the historical literature of Confucianism. But at second sight, Confucianism is indeed most oriented in the Classics and Historical Literature. Or we can say other components totally went to Museum or disappear, especially those dirty waste such as 纲常. ) It seems that the academic research on Confucianism also exert some influence on the society (many popular or general books on Confucianism are written by famous scholars). Besides, these researchers often give speeches. All I know can be generally divided into the above three divisions. And I faintly felt its weakness even though there are three kinds of strength. Perhaps one important cause is the orientation of official ideology, which put Confucianism at a very embarrassing situation. Compared to mathematics, we can find more about this embarrassment. To be honest, I felt China seems to be over-popularized by elementary mathematics, compared to other countries. It is a good thing because you can not find another proper substitute for us to popularize science (remember that other genre of science needs the experiment, which is hard for peripheral kids to accomplish. Here I have no intention to criticize the negative sides of popularizing elementary mathematics by the compulsory command of educational institutions. I only intend to mention the various streams, far more than those of Confucianism. At the very early age, children can be tutored by relatives on how to count numbers and calculate---I believe this is unbelievable in ancient times. Then at stage of kindergarten, and from six grades of primary school you have six different but similar forms of mathematics. At the next stage, then you have encountered another six different but similar forms. And alongside of these forms, two fascinating but also hard-reached form called Mathematical Competition and 自主招生 co-exist. Think of how our descendent will react to the educational history of mathematics of our period when they read related books written by researchers in the far future. Indeed, what is 自招 became trivial for them, and they probably would wonder why there are so many forms of mathematics because they can not distinguish different forms when they share very similar materials. It was really amazing that very little knowledge of elementary mathematics can generate so many forms automatically---it was really not automatic process propelled by mathematics itself. Here I finish the contrast between Confucianism and Mathematics because my main topic today is on Confucianism. But we can already see the essential behind the popularity of one business. We can never say that popularizing elementary mathematics can give direct impetus to the production of materials, and behind the operation of politics there were never absolutely rationale, far less than the research of science, because we only consider very few factors at the same time. (Remember that in Mathematical Analysis we consider the legality of changing limit process while in Mechanical Analysis, the solution of mechanical system is highlighted and the legality of mathematical symbol operations is neglected.) One golden rule of the so-called revival of Confucianism lies in the region of politics. But this approach is nearly impossible because of ideological causes. The luckiest simultaneously most unfortunate case is that this ideological animal popularizes Confucianism guided by Marxism, which has already happened and is very possible to enlarge in the future. But indeed all the three streams oppose strongly to this kind of politics. I on purpose did not regard the official efforts as the fourth ( or, from the strength, it is the first) stream because it is really not Confucianism but mainly Marxism. Based on my above views followed my naïve ideas in the next.</p>
<p>What great business can young people really accomplish? 梁公二十四岁于时务报上阐救亡图存之良言. He tried to resave the gradually lost confidence by emphasizing our strength. Some arguments are selected from Classics such as Book of Changes, for example, 否极泰来. He even tried to analyze the bad results in post-industrial developed country. This analysis is based on some social theory and is very irrationally used to a certain purpose. All of 梁 have done are beyond what we know about academics in university. The situation of non-academic environment is governed by another set of rule very different from that in academic environment. This is my first worry because I knew every step to do something beyond academic environment, or purely personal improvement, is full of danger.</p>
<p>But danger does not mean there is no possibility to make some attempt. Nowadays the self-start of business by university students is not rare things. The difference lies at the region...        </p>
