# Watching a movie
2009/10/30

Today is Friday, I'm very exhausted because I had seven classes and a meeting in the end. It includes all my courses for which I will take exams in mid-semester, like Physics, Chemistry, Politics and History.

All my teacher always said test is coming, I worried, so did my classmates. I thought the only interesting thing was watching English movie named **The Pursuit of Happyness**.Our head teacher screened it in the self-study class. Everyone was puzzled at first, but when we watched it up, we understood. It told us whatever happened, you must face the trouble bravely and beat it.

Also,every night I had lots of homework to do. I felt a little bitter but I pleased myself when I finished my tasks.

There is a long way to go over in the future. Let's come on together.
