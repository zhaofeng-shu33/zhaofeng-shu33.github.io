	<h1>Watching a movie</h1>
<p>2009/10/30</p>
<p>Today is Friday, I'm very exhausted because I had seven classes and a meeting in the end. It includes all my courses for which I will take exams in mid-semester, like Physics, Chemistry, Politics and History.</p>
<p>All my teacher always said test is coming, I worried, so did my classmates. I thought the only interesting thing was watching English movie named <strong>The Pursuit of Happyness</strong>.Our head teacher screened it in the self-study class. Everyone was puzzled at first, but when we watched it up, we understood. It told us whatever happened, you must face the trouble bravely and beat it.</p>
<p>Also,every night I had lots of homework to do. I felt a little bitter but I pleased myself when I finished my tasks.</p>
<p>There is a long way to go over in the future. Let's come on together.</p>
