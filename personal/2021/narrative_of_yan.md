# Narrative of Yan
2021/1/6

When I was at the second semester of fifth grade, I learned the story called
"Yan Zi To Chu" (晏子使楚). Yesterday night I read the expanded story in Chapter 69 of "Chronicles of the Eastern Zhou Kingdoms". Actually all stories are modified from "Yanzi chunqiu" (晏子春秋).
The edition of primary school chinese language by People's Education Press has been
updated twice after my graduation of primary school. I used the edition published in 2002. One update happened in 2009 and
the other happened in 2019. It seemed that the text "Yan Zi To Chu" was preserved in the latest edition. The story contained humorous reply of the politician Yan Zi when he had diplomatic business in the State Chu. The stories in Chronicles are in more detail, including 10 rebuttals by Yan Zi
while in the original literature "Yanzi chunqiu" there were only four. I think the author
of the Chronicles made up some stories within the context. But all of the made-up are plausible,
which reflect the ability of Yan Zi.
