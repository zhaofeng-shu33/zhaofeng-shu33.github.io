# A nightmare and career orientation
2021/7/5

Yesterday, after the exam of Japanese language,
I met my high school classmate Liu Fang. She
received me in a hotpot restaurant of Jiayuan,
which is near the living area of Peking campus.
Before I reached the promised place, by accident I found one
drama play scheduled tonight in the activity center.
After some initial investigation on the spot, I
thought it was possible for me to attend this artistic show.
This is really a good chance to appreciate the show.
After all, no equivalent club exists in Tsinghua.

It was approaching 5pm, so I waited Liu Fang in front of Jiayuan.
She called me from behind, and I realized that she became more mature than the figure in my memory when I met her a few years ago
in the time of classmate reunion. Though we had the relationship
in the level of high school classmate, I was not familiar with her.
The conversation between us was dominated mostly by information exchange from different background. Though she is in a department
of geologic, her actual research area bears more similarity of chemistry. As a result, it becomes difficult for people with
such background in job market. "There are only three ways out for us. First is entering the domain of public service. The
practical way is by 选调, which is an interior leadership selection in top
universities of China. The second way is changing your orientation,
while the last way is to find some teaching position, either middle
school teacher in big city or university in small city."
Liu Fang summarized her future situation in this way. It seemed that she was not determined while having some tendency for the
public service. It was said that the number of students in Peking
university applying
for such chance had reached a historical new level. It was easy
to understand. Even for PhD students from Tsinghua or Peking university, if their major falls within biology, chemistry,
environment or material science, it was very hard to find suitable
position in their domain.

After the rare meeting, we said farewell to each other, and I headed
to the activity center for the drama show. To my surprise,
few audience appeared in this site. Though this show was public, people outside campus were difficult to reach due to the regulation enforced in university level. That is, to prevent the
spread of Covid-19, only registered students can go out and come back to the campus. Unless invited by some registered student,
others are not allowed to enter the campus. Therefore, someone showed pity to miss this big drama in the website of huodongxing.
On the other hand, few Peking students came here. They may
have their own business. Is it a waste of quota? With such a near place, this 3 hour show
is worth 1,000 RMB at least in public theatres.
But to some
sense, the drama itself is the pursuit 
and realization of the players themselves. Even with few spectators
on the spot, they still tried their best to perform without payment.

The story was set in the period within first 10 years of Reform and Open-up. The transformation of domestic company is under way.
Though this era happened 30 years ago, the thoughts of figures in the play
were quite modern. The reflected conflicts still exist in current
Chinese society: the hard choice between family and career, between
integrity and interests, and so on.

Usually a commercial drama is split into 2 parts with a short break for the audience.
Each part lasts for about 1 hour (or shorter). But the drama
I watched lasted for almost 3 hours uninterruptedly. It
was also a challenge for audience. They may feel fatigued if
concentrating on such a long drama. Actually the drama performed
last night is only a part of 3 performs. Since the total time
for the whole display is more than 8 hours, it is split into
3 performs. Such a long time drama could not be delivered outside,
but it can tell a relative complete story of many figures,
and pointing out the complex relationship between them. This drama
is called "Red and While Family" (红白家族). Even the script is created by the member of drama club. I actually watched the
second perform, and wondered how it reflected the conflicts in the heart of contemporary youth.

I was tired and satisfied after the display, and fell asleep quickly after return. At night, I had a nightmare. My mother
had an accident and it was very likely she would lose her life
soon. During this extraordinary time, I accompanied her on the
side, trying to share with her important matters in our interweaved
life. At the same time, I criticized my father for his cruelty
since he was still busy with his jobs. Then I woke up suddenly.
It was merely 5 am. It was merely a nightmare. But it showed
some important topic in my life, didn't it? my junior classmate, Liu Yue only told me she determined to find a job in hometown due
to consideration of family. Also my mother came to Guangzhou as
a sacrifice for the family. What will be my choice?
