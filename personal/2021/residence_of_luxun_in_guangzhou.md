# Residence of Lu Xun in Guangzhou
2021/2/20

When I went to Sun Yat-sen Library for the second time, I visited the nearby
Luxun's museum by the way. Through this famous writer, I knew more about the
history of that time and the origin of left-wing literature. On the second floor
of this small museum, there are two separate rooms for treasury of Xiao Hong and another left-wing
writer Ouyang Shan respectively. They are less famous than Lu Xun but had some places in the
modern Chinese literature. I did not recognize that it was almost noon when I walked out of
the museum, and my original plan to go through the foreign book hall of the library was nearly
out of time. Still, I managed to peek some german books in the library, which were provided
by Goethe-Institute of Hongkong.

On the way back to my residence, I wondered the meaning of
cultural exploration. At almost the same time last year, I went to the national library of Russia
every day, though I could only understand a little of that foreign language. To one extend,
the library as public space provides free access for people who had the ability to teach themselves.
On another extreme stands the educational institution or company, which charges the learner by selling
knowledge. I still thought little about the latter, as I did a few years ago. Museum had also
functionality to teach people but restricted to historical subject. Interestingly there is a new
kind of museum called "science museum", which focuses on the contemporary science education.
There are also other kinds of museums devoted to other subjects, which presents specific
knowledge in the form other than books. But I knew little about these subjects and therefore have
little interests. From the perspective of public service, the libraries and the museums
have equal importance. But from the personal view, one can go to the library every day but
can only visit the museum in a much less frequency. To some extent it illustrated that the density
of knowledge provided by book is much higher than that exhibited in the museum.

In the epoch of internet, the obtainment of knowledge becomes more diversified.
In some specific domain like IT technology it is even less practical to read a paperback textbook.
However, by merging myself into other fields, such as foreign language
and Confucianism,
I found there were indispensabilities to read a book
than total online learning. Some combination of the two is helpful, but the emphasis is put
on the side of the book, rather than the material of webpages, electronic documents, audios (music)
or videos.

To study a field, although personal efforts are important, the surrounding environment also
plays an important role. What if you were surrounded with people who studies the same
or similar fields as you, and you could discuss with each other? Definitely the progress
is faster than studying alone. However, environment could be strived but not created from scratch.
Friends with common interest are rare and a circle is even harder to settle in. For myself I
was member of an informal circle which studied advanced mathematical tools and machine learning theory problems. It is more beneficial for me to involve into this circle when it is still on my side.
To be expected, this circle reached its peak when Jin Sima became involved. But Sima had left, and the circle will dissolve once Xiangxiang Xu went to MIT. At that time, I will probably go to Beijing for
an internship. The left time is not much, and what will my "last" semester in Shenzhen look like?
I am looking forward to experience this last chapter with passion and patience.
