# Visiting Longhu Mountain
2021/3/6

Today Sima, Xinyi and I went to the sacred mountain of Tao --- Mount Longhu.
The whole area is a part of Guixi County. After a drive of an hour we
arrived at the entrance of the Mount Longhu. There were only few tourists, and it seemed
to be the low season for this place.

After the ticket checking we took the tour bus to deep into the mountain.
The first place we visited was called Zheng Yi Temple (正一观). A guide, who
seemed to be a Taoism priest, encouraged us to donate some incense money.
Xinyi smiled to him but without any action, and I followed him.
The temple itself was situated in a quiet place, surrounded by mountains with red cliffs and abundant
green plants. Xinyi carefully examined the couples inscribed on the sides of the portal.
He explained the principles of couples, which should be followed when modern people are creating
new ones. "Using the modern pronunciation, the level and oblique tones should interlace with
each other at the even position for sentences with five or seven characters. For shorter sentences
with three or four characters, the requirement can be neglected. But for all sentences, the last
character of the first half and the second half of the couplet should have opposite tones. And
the opposite rules are also true for the characters at the even position for sentences with 5 or
7 characters."

Then we floated by bamboo raft to the place where fairy rock is located. I could not figure
out why the rock represents a fairy while Xinyi explained that it was like the genital organ
of a woman. I agreed with his judgment and we went on. Then we met a staff from a nearby
restaurant, who guided us there. I suspected she may rip us off. Xinyi told me not to worry,
since there was too few tourists today. To some extent such situation was caused by today's bad
weather. It always rained and makes climbing more dangerous than normal time.

In the afternoon, we walked the show of hanging cliff, which was a special tomb customs at this place
in ancient times. To our disappointment, the museum to show the danxia landform and ancient customs.

Our final destination is the Celestial Masters' Mansion (天师庙). The staffs there was almost getting off work when we arrived there. The structure of the mansion was similar to the temple we visited in
the morning, but with larger area and older trees.

The time to spend with Sima was short. After we came back to Guixi County in the evening, we
had to say goodbye to him. Sima treated us for several meals these two days, and we could
never forget his hospitality in the remaining life.
