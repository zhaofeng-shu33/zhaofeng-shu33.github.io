	<h1>The celebration of anniversary</h1>
<p>2021/4/25</p>
<p>The 110th anniversary of Tsinghua University is coming. Though it was lively
in the main campus of Tsinghua, we discussed more on what we could get in Shenzhen.
Originally I forwarded a message of registration to the wechat group of our lab.
This registration is for attending the Shenzhen branch venue, which will play the global
broadcast of the anniversary evening party. The next day, Xinyi reminded us that this
registration was rewarding, "Don't forget that it will distribute the souvenir shirt
for attendees." So Weida, Xinyi and I all applied for the allocation. I found that
the channel for students was simply to fill an online doc. Editing the doc doesn't
need authentication, which means that outsiders who subscribed the wechat account
of Sigs association can grab all sensitive information (including our telephones)
from this big table. As we put in our information, there were already more than
500 records. So was it a mistake by the representatives of the association? Maybe not.
The registration channel for Sigs staffs is the traditional way of filling and submitting forms.
Each person can only reach his own information. So why there is such differentiation between
staff members and students? I could not figure out the reason.</p>
<p>Both my roommate and Zhiyuan Wu thought less of the restaurant besides the Canteen of Lotus 1.
The restaurant was called "嗒糖占美", majoring in western cuisine but also serves Chinese dishes.
The price is quite high, and we don't think it's affordable. The mysterious fact is that the business of this
restaurant is good, instead of closing down. I explained such abnormal phenomena as the existence of rich
students, well-paid staffs and business man in the weekends. The training center in our campus provides
management courses for entrepreneurs outside. To astonish us more, a new book bar opened up on the first
floor of Information Building. This book bar claimed that it will light up for 24 hours in the future, though it only opened up in normal time in recent days.
the. Yongchi Zhu complained that he would rather have McDonald in the same place.
"So you could have wonderful food if you stayed up late." Zhiyuan complained that
the price for the dessert and teas in this book bar was so high that he could 
buy several cups of tea on the second floor of Lotus 1 Canteen.</p>
<p>Back to the entrance application for the branch venue. I could not imagine why
so many students applied. Xinyi said it was merely for the souvenir suit.
But the number of seats was limited in the biggest hall of our campus, which only
allows 500 people in maximum. Considering the attendance of staffs and alumins,
there were fewer seats for students. Under such circumstance, both Guodong Li
and Yongchi Zhu missed the qualification for one seat.</p>
<p>Besides the souvenir shirt, the other souvenirs are packed into a bundle, which
are distributed in the group of different classes. The representative of TBSI 17 doctors
came late and he was told that no more bundles remained. As a result, Fei Ma
and Mingyang had to wait for several days before the supplement bundles arrived.</p>
<p>Another optional souvenir was a special pair of shoe, sponsored by Huili. To obtain
this, students had to collect 110 "Up" in their wechat moment. Two many students
wanted the shoes, and the supplement turned not to be enough. As a result, the size
was not matched for some students. "It was said such a pair was sold for more than 1000 Yuan
in second hand market." Xinyi commented.</p>
