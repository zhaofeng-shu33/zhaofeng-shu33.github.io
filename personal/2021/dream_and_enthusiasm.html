	<h1>Dream and enthusiasm</h1>
<p>2021/2/24</p>
<p>Recently I slept regularly but had several vivid dreams when I was asleep.
Though I forgot many details, one of these dreams still left a vague contour
in my memory. The story happened in a campus where I met Wang Han, an old
female friend of mine from junior school. The exact name of the campus
and the time of meeting was hidden forever. Maybe it was during high school. She left me a message, and hurried away. I opened the paper note, packed carefully
by the sender, and saw the delicate hand-writings in Chinese:</p>
<p>Feng, may I ask you
for an appointment in xxx at the xxx time? I had important matters to discuss
with you. --- Han</p>
<p>I could not figure out what the important matters pointed to, and hesitated for a while, when one of my male friends passed by and peeked into the note. He padded my
shoulder and winked at me: "Make sure not to miss this opportunity for an unforgettable dating!" I did not reply to his mystifying voices and thought it
as only a normal chance to ask for some help in study.</p>
<p>I went to the exact place at the exact time. No acquaintances are nearby.
Han, in a student suit, elbows supported on the table, put his two tiny hands together in front of her chest, sat on a bench. I entered the room and greeted her
in a polite voice. She raised her eyes and smiled to welcome my coming.
Then I asked her directly the specific purpose of this appointment.</p>
<p>"Do you think science disciplines are superior over humanity counterparts?"</p>
<p>I was astonished for such an inquiry. After thinking for a while, I replied,</p>
<p>"There were neither superior subjects nor inferior ones. You felt humanity was
inferior since the external environment thought less on it. But viewing the comparison from a broader perspective, humanity is eternal while science is transient. You cannot understand ancient astrology while it is easier for modern
Chinese to appreciate Tang poems."</p>
<p>I did not think I expressed my opinion well but from her look, she seemed to agree
with me, at least partially.</p>
<p>"So why are some students are good at science while others can not reach proficiency
even though they work very hard?" As she said, the word "even though" was emphasized
in a blaming tone.</p>
<p>It seemed that I encountered similar question before, so I answered her immediately:
"Do not say statement in that way. You are a hard-working girl, who deserves
rewards in the future. Maybe the rewards are not immediately visible but it will arrive definitely in some unexpected form. Moreover, you will probably find someone 
who are good at science as your boyfriend. Then the combination is wonderful since
no question is unanswerable by this couple." I joked in the last sentence but I soon
regretted such prediction, since at that time, I was the outstanding boy who do well in science.</p>
<p>Her face became red and a slight voice came as follows,</p>
<p>"Really? I hope that day will come."</p>
<p>The above story was plausible for two high school students. There are no reference
to complex things in adult world and their values are as simple as humanity versus
science. Regret to say, it never happened
in reality.</p>
<p>The underlining reasons that I could have such an amazing dream were complex. With the
recent email communication with Han, written in German, I knew that she was going to
devote her doctor study to some antique humanity topic. Ironically, she met a partner
with science background accidentally. For my part, I had undergone some process of
turning back and picked up my old enthusiasm towards humanity.</p>
<p>In my nearby reality, Xiangxiang Xu can be regarded to the unique person who had
passion for mathematics. As he told us, he even taught his niece with some interesting
mathematical problems during the spring festival. That is probably why he could make
much greater achievements than others, I think.</p>
