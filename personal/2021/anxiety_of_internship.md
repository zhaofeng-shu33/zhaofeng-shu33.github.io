# Anxiety of Internship
2021/4/15

When I passed the technical interview of Noah lab, I thought it was almost sure for this chance of internship.
However, I neglected the obstacles on the side of HR. Indeed, after I failed the first characteristic test.
I doubted myself a little about my fitness in Huawei, since I filled the blank from heart. The reason
of failure may also lie at the fact that I seldom chose negative answers to descriptions. The project manager
told me there was another try for this test. So this time I referred to some experiences on zhihu and finished it by guessing the favorable type in Huawei. But I also felt not confident, whether I could pass the second characteristic test.
So what would be the cause if I failed for the second time? I could not imagine. This became the cause of my sleepless
state in the night. I thought over in general my fitness in career.

Yesterday noon, I told my worry of future career to Xinyi Tong and Weida Wang, both of whom conducted theoretical
research like me. I told them according to my recent experience, theoretical research is not popular when it
comes to the environment of career. Xinyi said it would be better if I could consider some teaching position in universities of small cities. He took Changzhou University as an example, which was one of his intentions after graduation.

I thought it was not possible to find a teaching position in big cities
like Beijing with only doctor degree. After trading off between
salary, ambition and ability, there was little choice for me except for
several big tech companies.

Most of my companions conducted research in the field of artificial intelligence,
which was a new field and very popular in tech companies in recent years.
I thought the skillfulness in artificial intelligence was quite narrow. But I could not
deny that it would be easier if I were also good at such field.

As far as I can grab, the career fields which I had some competence lies at finance evaluation,
numerical simulation or web development. For the first, in fact I knew very little about finance
but my background in statistics and probability provides me good chance to succeed. The strongest
strength is that my research relies on techniques in probability, though it may not be the same as
that used in finance. For the third, to some sense I was capable to be a full stack developer. But
this field changes very fast and it focuses on development. It did not need research ability.
I thought the most probable field is the second one. At least simulation study is also a part of
my daily research, and I liked and put importance on it. The main shortness for me is that
numerical computational aspect is not the main contribution of my research.

Back to reality, if I failed for the internship opportunity of Huawei. I had to seek in other big
companies for research
or development opportunity in the field of numerical simulation. It would not be an easy task,
and I had to hurry up in order to have something to do in the summer.
