	<h1>The internship propaganda of Alibaba</h1>
<p>2021/4/27</p>
<p>This evening, I toke part in the offline propaganda, held at HSBC Business School.
Fei Ma also went with me. He told me that he had applied the internship position
in Hangzhou, though he did not plan to go there. The meeting room was crowded when
we came there. It came out Ziyan Zheng was also on the spot, and we sat beside him.
Ziyan talked with Fei Ma on the middle school teaching position at Shenzhen, and
Fei Ma expressed his interest in such kind of jobs. This presentation is held
for the city Shenzhen. As a result, students from other universities also came here
to get the latest information. What the engineers actually talked did not interest me.
Fei Ma worried that he could not get any useful gifts, and it turned out to be true.
He didn't have the chance to ask a question, since there were many competitors raising
their hands. "There are still many gifts left on the table of the first row." Fei complained
when quitting the room. I explained it as the gifts reserved for their next city.</p>
