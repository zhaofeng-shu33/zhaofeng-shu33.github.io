# Writing Chinese report
2021/3/19

After passing the qualification exam, I had to write a report on my doctor project.
The report should contain literature review and my research plan in at least 5000
Chinese characters. At the same time, Yang Bai requested my help on some mathematical
problem in her next paper. Besides, I also spent some hours to figure out
a rendering problem in mediawiki software. To balance these tasks, I found I had no time
to prepare for the coming German exam.

During the process of writing the review in Chinese, I wondered why there was no Chinese
entry for terminology in wikipedia. Some of them are used in spoken language when I discussed
problem with others. Unfortunately, one article I tried to add was classified to have copyright
issues, since I copied it from a local wiki site called "集智百科".

I wondered why the ability to localize can make people tolerant. In such sense,
contents from baidu should also be respected even though it has many issues.
English becomes international no more than forty years. It is not so important in history.
In such sense, the efforts of localization such as translation project should also be respected.
Each region has its own local community besides the international one.
