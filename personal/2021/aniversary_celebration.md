# The celebration of anniversary
2021/4/25

The 110th anniversary of Tsinghua University is coming. Though it was lively
in the main campus of Tsinghua, we discussed more on what we could get in Shenzhen.
Originally I forwarded a message of registration to the wechat group of our lab.
This registration is for attending the Shenzhen branch venue, which will play the global
broadcast of the anniversary evening party. The next day, Xinyi reminded us that this

students, well-paid staffs and business man in the weekends. The training center in our campus provides
management courses for entrepreneurs outside. To astonish us more, a new book bar opened up on the first
floor of Information Building. This book bar claimed that it will light up for 24 hours in the future, though

Yongchi Zhu complained that he would rather have McDonald in the same place.
