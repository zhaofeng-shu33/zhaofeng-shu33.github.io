# Two outgoings
2021/1/25

Yesterday morning I went out to attend an activity held by "Association of Confucian Scholars" (儒士社) in formal suit. Members of this association have more
or less beliefs in Confucian doctrines. I have some tendency for it but it 
is hard to say for sure. The procedures of etiquette were formal while the lunchtime became casual. As said by The Classics of Poetry, it is ok to be relaxed in eating time
but never drink too much. Wanton behave of some members made me disgusted.
Besides, I found what the leader said were too boastful. It was hard to believe
whether he could make it in reality.

The second outgoing happens this morning. I accompanied Fei Ma to 
Peking University Shenzhen Hospital for a renewed examination.
The waiting time was quite long while the examination time was very short.
Both Fei and I do not think highly of doctors in this hospital.
Fei also said his attitude changing towards Professor Huang and
senior fellow Xiangxiang. "They always push me to do experiments but provide
no useful suggestions. It is really hard to communicate with the two."
Fei hoped to become independent researcher within the topic he chose.
