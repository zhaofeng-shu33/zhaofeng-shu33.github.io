# Anecdotes

Yesterday, when we ate at McDonald of the Peking site, Xinyi mentioned
the mysophobia of Weida, who could not bear that him wooden-made spoon
was placed on the table by mistake. During time period when he headed for a new spoon
in the counter, Xinyi said, "It is indeed what Weida does. In the Canteen of Lotus
1, he could not bear that the chopsticks were placed on the tray directly." I agreed
with the comment of Xinyi. Once Weida explained the reason, "You know the
the bottom side of tray was not clean. When the trays are placed one on the another,
the top side also becomes dirty. When you placed chopsticks in that way, the
bacterium runs to your chopsticks. It is terrible!"

But one could not imagine such a handsome student with tendency for cleanness
usually has dandruff on his head. Such unpleasant matter was pointed out by
Xinyi many times. Though Weida washed his head last night, it appeared again
after sleep, unless he washed in the morning. But as far as I can guess,
Weida hurried to the lab in the morning without combing. He is often spotted
to have breakfast in the public space of the 11th floor. He was not an early
type, so he had to hurry up for the remaining morning time.

When we ate happily, Xinyi argued with me the origin of the world "调羹".
I insisted that it was an imported word from foreign countries while Xinyi
thought it was a local word. "You know, in ancient times, we have used the spoon
for the purpose of compass. It is natural for the same thing to have different names."
Xinyi said. I looked up the word online and admitted my false claim.
But I also found something interesting. Indeed, this word has multiple meanings.
I read aloud the verse, "同来与妾共调羹" and allowed Xinyi to guess the meaning
of this word within this sentence. "Maybe cooking together?" Xinyi thought
it was a natural extended meaning for this word. I told others
that it actually hinted making love. "It makes sense. It must point to a
kind of pose when making love." Xinyi said.

Weida reminded us that it was the second day of the diet cycle of Xinyi:
"No wonder Xinyi ate in such terrible manner. He was restrained for several
meals." I agreed that this excessive eating spoiled his plan. "It doesn't matter,"
Xinyi replied, "I can restart from tomorrow." As far as we know, both Fei Ma 
and Xiangxiang in our lab have developed a habit for restricted eating, which
is healthier than eating habits of others.

When Xinyi ate burgers like a wolf, I asked him to describe in Japanese his feeling,
he said "幸せな顔". "Why don't you use 美味しい ?" I wondered.
He replied, "Such word is too common, and you can even add some adverbs in front like
とでも美味しい." Weida suggested me to speak in different languages to different people.
As Weida behaved like an English gentleman, I can speak English with him.
"With Xinyi, it is definitely ancient Chinese. For Zhiyuan, it should be linux language." Such comment astonished Zhiyuan, who
said "I think I could occupy the position of Chinese."

When we returned from the fast food restaurant to our Information Building, we had
to pass the square in front of the bureau of university town. Last evening
it was occupied by the exhibition of Huawei cloud. But we could not have an inside look, since we did not
have the tickets.
