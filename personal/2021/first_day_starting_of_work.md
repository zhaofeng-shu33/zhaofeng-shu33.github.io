# First day of starting of work
2021/2/22

By the early train from Guangzhou to Shenzhen I came back after seven days.
The weather is almost the same in the two places, always sunny and rainless
with relatively high temperature in the winter. So what have I changed
during the short time and what my view of the environment has changed?

Honestly speaking, the library of Shenzhen is more crowded and with less diversified books.
By personal experience I felt the cultural inferiority of Shenzhen for the first time.
But Shenzhen has more to do with contemporary art exhibitions. I had read this statement in a
magazine of one library.

It needs only a little greet to reconnect with old friends of my lab. At noon, we had
a simple lunch together in the Lotus 1 Canteen. Many windows had been opened only one or two days
ago. The center of the discussion focused some anecdotes of Professor Huang.
The canteen was crowded, in sharp contrast with the state a few days ago, when only one window
was opened and few students went to and fro.

This morning I took the first class, taught by Professor Huang. The name of the course is
"Large Deviation Theory", which is a quite theoretical course for graduate students.
The result turns out that only 4 students have enrolled in this course and all belongs
to my lab. The first class is merely some review on probability theory. Xinyi Tong, the
teaching assistant, found that the living notes given by the professor was almost the same
as the condensed material from the course "Probability", which was taught jointly by
Professor Huang and Ye. Taking notes is not a creative work and I almost fell asleep near
the end of the class. Weida Wang, who sat on the right side of me, only used his eyes
and ears for this first class, and I wondered whether such way could leave a deep impression
of knowledge. The idea of Huang, or the purpose of graduate course, is similar. That is,
different from the purpose of undergraduate courses, now it serves the research purpose.
"There are so many courses, whatever you choose should be beneficial to your research."
Professor Huang said.

This afternoon, I went to the secretary office to inquire my delayed grant of TA last semester.
From this semester on, the courses of the two institutes are managed centrally by a grand
institute called "Sigs", shorthand for Shenzhen Institute of Graduate School I think.
The secretary Xuan said it was marked that due to system delays several TAs had not received
their salary yet and it was expected to be finished before the end of this month.
After hearing that, my tensed heart relieved, thinking that it was not a fundamental mistake
by the office of academic affairs. Needless to say, adults are more concerned with the
financial aspect of life. A majority of my peers do not put the money they earned
in the bank but used them to get some interests through safe investment.
My mind on financial management is quite conservative, since I thought it costed extra time
to make good portfolio.

After the tense atmosphere in the daytime, it became pleasant to enjoy the evening when we
can freely exchange the unique part of spring festival stories. Xinyi Tong
recommended a Ming history book which I had read thoroughly before. The name is called
"Lecture notes on Ming History" by Meng Sen. I wondered why
this textbook, written almost ninety years ago, was still popular today, while Xinyi
thought more about his out-dated historical views.
