	<h1>Intellectual group</h1>
<p>2021/6/28</p>
<p>Before I departed for Beijing, I hosted a dinner with some familiar guys
in my lab. Throughout the chaos and toast, I wondered how the luck,
which brought us together, looked like. Indeed, it needs a special system called 
graduate education. However, when we talked about graduate education, the
focus is often the relationship between the mentor and the student. The
interaction between different students in the same circle is often neglected.
Does this kind of relationship look like that between colleagues in workplace?
It may be true. Though I was quite familiar with Fei Ma, I thought he
was too realistic, and we were merely friends on the worldly level.
On the other hand, members in "Neither learning or skills" share a common
ideal though their specific focus varies. That is the mind of chasing for relative truth. Xiangxiang Xu, as a senior member, devoted almost all his time
in theoretical research problems. He considers problems not in
worldly perspectives but with philosophical eyes. Xinyi Tong, third-year phd
student, balanced his life with different kinds of interests.
Knowledge and fun are unified in his figure. Weida Wang, an amusing second-year
phd student, also obtained his inspiration from the western civilization.
These three and I consist of this group called "Neither learning or skills" (不学无术群).
But today I have to say farewell to Xiangxiang, who would depart for USA soon.
The group photo of Xiangxiang and I was taken last night with the background of 100th anniversary for
our party.</p>
<p>At the same time, I also worried a lot about my near future. Though the Covid situations turn
better at Shenzhen in recent days, the strict controlling measures are still effective.
I was not sure whether I could reach my dormitory in Beijing smoothly. Besides, the pending
internship and the exam are waiting for me. In the term of statistics, my near future has large
variance.</p>
