	<h1>Right choice</h1>
<p>2021/6/5</p>
<p>This afternoon, Mingyang Li told Xiangxiang his worry that Mr. Huang was not satisfied with his
research. "When I followed his ideas, I found it was hard to make something out. When I advanced
in my one interest, Mr. Huang was not satisfied. It was indeed a dilemma." After hearing his
complain, Xiangxiang thought of his own story. During his initial period of PhD study,
Xiangxiang was asked by Mr. Zhang to write engineering codes for a big project. This job
did not attract Xiangxiang very much, but he had no choice. "The problem is that, if I was
replaced by another student, who was enthusiastic about coding, the situation would be different."
Xiangxiang signed.</p>
<p>After the storm of breakup and reunion with Yang Bai, my lifestyle was adjusted.
From the practice of the past week, I found that when I pushed myself too much in learning,
I became completely rational, which was disastrous for the romantic relationship.
When I was following my previous way, I had time to consider for daily life beyond daily learning.
For example, I could go to the Pingshan Village to buy some lychee. Now it is the season for lychee,
and it becomes common to find sellers outside the campus.</p>
<p>Recently a few new Covid cases were reported in Guangzhou. The measures were strengthened there,
and it seemed impossible for me to visit my parents after next week. My mother came to Guangzhou
last month and lived together with my father. The new cases influence the mind of people towards
the vaccines. My roommate Pengyang Zhao and my friend Zhiyuan Wu, had a hard experience to receive the first dose in places far from the campus.</p>
