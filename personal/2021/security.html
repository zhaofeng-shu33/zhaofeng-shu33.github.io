	<h1>Security</h1>
<p>2021/5/29</p>
<p>Today is the birthday for Weida. Due to tighter regulation against Covid-19, we avoided dining outside and celebrated it
at the second floor of Lotus 2 Canteen.
Xinyi bought a cake for Weida. Mingyang Li and Xiangyu Chen also joined.
Recently, Xinyi joined the group of Arknights as a novice and often consulted Weida for some tips. This noon I argued with Xinyi on whether the Chinese idioms "good relationship between Qin and Jin" (秦晉之好) can represent the marriage between a couple.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Yang Bai got up late so that we went out for some good clothes at 3pm.
We firstly arrived at the Yuefang Square, near Liuxiandong.
The shopping mall is quite empty, except for the hotness of Heytea.
Yang Bai chose a T-shirt and a pair of shorts for me. Though she tried some siamese
skirts, she didn't feel satisfied and abandon the plan to buy one. Besides,
the number of clothing stores are quite small that we soon finished the stroll.
Then Yang Bai decided to "OUTINA" near Vanke Cloud City, a local brand for the beauty of women. She had registered for a member of such brand with a large amount of membership dues. After that, we had dinner with hotpot.
I showed her the birthday gift, which was a new brand of Mi Smart Band.
However, Yang Bai said that she did not like wearing the band. "In my home we have
a lot of different bands, but it is seldom used." I felt disappointed that my choice
did not match the desire of her. Then she said "How about iPod? I really need it."
Hearing this, my first thought is that an iPod sells for 2,000 Yuan. 
So I hesitated for a while before I asked for an assurance of Yang Bai.
Seeing my hesitation, Yang Bai felt angry and answered that she had already an iPod.
Her annoyance is not like a violent storm, but a cold ice putting on my skin.
She commented, "Both of us need a time to reconsider our relationship when
you went to Beijing."</p>
<p>At that time, though we sat face to face, I felt there were a thousand miles
between us. The boiling hotspot suddenly became a trench of violent stream,
making it impossible for me to go over. The waiter served each of us a cup of
lemon water. Yet, I felt it extremely sour after a taste.</p>
<p>I looked at Yang Bai, who was reading some entertainment news.
I tried to explain something but it was a long time before I could open my mouth.
Yang Bai answered that she felt disappointed to my economic suitable view.
Indeed, the recollection of a trivial dissatisfaction was enough to explode one's
temper. After my apology, Yang also felt the problem of herself. As a lady
lacking security from childhood, she also had difficulty in dealing with intimate
relationships. I described her behavior as putting the other away when the distance
was too close. After the reconcilement, I wanted to say words of blessing but I started
with the wrong direction, "Yang Bai, you are 27 years old now. In the past 27 years,
so many people appeared and disappeared in our lives." I suddenly felt choked while
saying the idiom "来来往往". To my surprise, Yang Bai also could not resist her tears
when I summarized the past in a few sentences. To cheer her up, I retold the 
story of Asa Huang, whose confidant changed a word of her dedication from "best"
to "beautiful". I said, "In the future, there will also be happiness to be expected.
Though the pleasant time of the past could not come back, they are worth cherishing."
After the discussion of the influence of family life on our growth, the topic comes
to reality. Yang Bai sticks to her point that I should focus on the immediate return,
trying to publish papers with high citation and trying to obtain a job with high salary.</p>
<p>When our discussion finished, we went to the nearby shopping malls to seek good
clothes for Yang Bai. The efforts turned vain, as no clothes matched the heart of her
exactly. "Maybe online shopping provides more choices." said she.</p>
