# A discussion with Xinyu Tian
2021/4/30

This morning I discussed my research problem with Xinyu Tian. He pointed out my logic errors
in the deduction. We also extended our topic to other aspects. He told me that he graduated from
Civil Engineering Department of Tsinghua University. However, due to failure of recommendation in his
fourth year of undergraduate study, he earned a quota of master student in TBSI. But he was
not satisfied with the current research topic. "Ercan let me to predict the speed of wind using
time series. What's the meaning of such topic?" He complained. He also told me his try to change
the mentor from Ercan to Shao-Lun Huang. "But Mr. Huang disagreed." He signed. I consoled him
that Mr. Huang changed his mind this semester and nearly didn't admit master students this
semester. "Your foundation of math is solid." I praised him. "This is because I had obtained
the second degree from mathematic department in Tsinghua." I was astonished, since it is very
hard for students to get such a degree. They need to finish 8 courses delivered by math department.

The girl Yifei Yan, who was not good at math, became the doctor student of Min Ye at first.
However, she found it was too difficult to follow the research style of her mentor. Yi Yan,
another doctor student, told me that she had changed her mentor now. For Xinyu Tian, who
could not be qualified as a doctor student due to the current system in China, couldn't find
a suitable mentor either.
