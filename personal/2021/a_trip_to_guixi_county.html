	<h1>A trip to Guixi County</h1>
<p>2021/3/5</p>
<p>This morning Xinyi and I traveled to Nanchang by plane. Then Xinyi rented
a car and drove with me to the Guixi County. After three hours we came to
the destination finally. It was about an hour later than our plan due to
traffic jam. Xinyi followed the traffic rules strictly and showed his
resentment towards rule breakers. Today's weather was rainy. Xinyi
said many parts of southern China entered a stage of rainy season nowadays.
The canola flowers on the roadside has bloomed. "The spring is coming."
Xinyi said. During the journey we passed frequently different bridges.
Xinyi explained that there are many water roads in the province of Jiangxi and
that is why there are many bridges.</p>
<p>After a tiring drive we met Sima, who wore a down-padded garment. I wondered whether
it was so cold here. Before the departure my father told me that the
temperature in Jiangxi was almost 10 degrees lower than that in Shenzhen.
I had changed my upper clothes at the airport of Nanchang. The first time I felt
a little cold was when we three were at a restaurant. </p>
<p>Xinyi had not eaten anything for up to eight hours. Therefore he had a good
stomach for the lunch, treated by Sima. Besides the introduction of local
customs, Sima also talked with me about the proof errors in our recent submitted paper.</p>
<p>After the lunch we drove to the Vienna hotel for the noon break. The hotel was located
near a park and a river, and our room allows a good perspective over the scenery.
We slept for two hours and headed for the dinner hosted by the father of Sima.
His father was the boss of a state-owned company and talked about many general
principles of social life. The family was also quite hospitality, and we felt as home from home.</p>
