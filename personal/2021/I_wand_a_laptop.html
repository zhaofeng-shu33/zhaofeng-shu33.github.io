	<h1>I want a game laptop</h1>
<p>2021/2/9</p>
<p>After climbing I went to the familiar
Chinese fast food restaurant selling
"fish with pickles".
During my eating I heard a thoughtful dialogue from a nearby family.</p>
<p>A beautiful young lady who received
undergraduate education in Guangdong
asked her mother for money to buy
a game laptop. Her father kept in silence.
It seems that her mother dominates
domestic matters such as budgets of large
amounts per purchase.
The female student said her existing
iPad was not suitable for entertainment
purpose, and she needs specific device
for such purpose. The supporting reason gave by the student focused on
the equipment of her roommates. "At least two of my roommates have a game laptop."
The mother, dissatisfied
to the competing state mind of her girls, argued that she already owned many electronic
devices, phones, pad and computer. So why bothered another computer for gaming purpose?
Besides, the newly bought laptop has large probability to be stolen. These are weak
statements I think. The mother did not hit the point. The young lady was indulged
since her childhood. Her appearance is neat and modern. Good nutrition and enough leisure
make her owning good appearance. But it is hard to say she has a good temper. Maybe that is
the common problem with ladies with similar family background. My ex-girlfriend belongs to
this line.</p>
<p>After discussing the plausibility of buying new laptop, the mother complained about
her laziness of not buying breakfast in the morning. "You should go to the canteen to
get something to eat, at least." Then the student explained and retorted to her mother.
During these conversations, I found the father seldom expressed his opinion. "The fish
is delicious" may be the only sentence he uttered. I guess his job is engineering, as
most engineers do work than talking. Her mother may be a university professor. In
either way, both of them are busy with their job I think. The virtue education is thus 
neglected in her childhood.</p>
