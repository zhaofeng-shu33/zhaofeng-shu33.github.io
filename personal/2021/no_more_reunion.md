# No more reunion
2021/5/5

This evening Xinyi organized several doctors
for a dinner outside. The joiners include Guodong Li, Weida Wang, Xiangyu Chen and I.
It is said that some
doctors including Fei Ma, Mingyang Li and others
didn't come due to some reasons. I am afraid it will be harder to invite them
in the future.

Yesterday evening, when I came back after climbing. I heard an old woman, who works as a cleaner in
the nearby subway station of Taoyuan Village
complained to another old man that she could
not earn more than 80 Yuan a day. Hearing that, I wondered, what
is the meaning for her work? Once there was
a very old woman which went hot on short video platform. The short video is not issued
by herself but by the fresh content seekers.
It turns out that the hot of the video concerning her brings much more
stress to her than actual benefits. All these
seekers only considered their own interest from reporting such encouraging figure, rather
than donating their earned money to this
pitiful old woman. I think reporting is not always a good thing because others have their own privacy.
If you could not help them but only for your own interests by documenting their stories. It is harmful
for the protagonist.
