	<h1>You cannot graduate</h1>
<p>2021/4/28</p>
<p>After receiving the internship offer of Huawei Noah lab, I knew I had to confirm 
the matter again with Mr. Huang. The problem that Mr. Huang had already mentioned
that I did not explain a research problem well last Monday when the course of large
deviation theory was delivered. At that time, he said angrily I could not graduate
if I still explained in such a bad way. This time, I had no idea what he would say.
I decided to knock on his door.</p>
<p>The glass wall beside the office door of Mr. Huang is covered by a thick grey cloth inside. As a result, visitors
cannot peek into the inside room. The last time I went near this door, as I can remember, was to celebrate
his birthday. Embarrassingly, he was not in the office. I urged big brother Xiangxiang to call him. Xiangxiang
only said, "I had sent him a wechat message. He will reply if he saw it." After waiting several minutes in front
of his door, we had no choice but to go back to our own desks respectively. A first year master student of Mr. Huang,
who never appeared before, had joined our waiting. But it is not convenient for him to go back since he did not
have a fixed seat in the room.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang opened the door, seeing me, without a word, waiving his hands to let me go.
Maybe he is on some remote meeting? Why without any explanations. I had no idea. This moment
was by accident witnessed by Xiangxiang, who was a passer-by. He asked me what happened?
"It seems that Mr. Huang doesn't like to meet me." Then I pressed the button of elevators, deciding to go climbing
according to my original plan every week.</p>
<p>Though it was only 4 pm. The cloud was thick in the sky, making the outside world dim.
I was a bit worried whether it would rain. On another thought, I was always lucky to escape raining on the journey
of climbing.</p>
<p>Seating in the subway, I opened wechat, finding Mr. Huang sent me a message and let me come now.
Without any choice, I decided to go back to school. Luckily, the subway hadn't started. But I was
still charged if I came out from the port of the same station. Riding a shared bike, I returned
the Information Building. Mr. Huang seemed quite calm this time, I told him my internship plan timidly.
Indeed, I only told him I will stay in Beijing from July to September, though I intended to stay until
December to take some language courses while continuing the internship. Though consented, Mr. Huang
mentioned two requirements before I reach his level of graduation.
The first is on my presentation and the second is on my research product. For the second, "You can continue
the discontinued topic on applying maximum correlation to network embedding problems. Anyway, you should discuss
with me regularly by yourself."</p>
<p>After the short meeting, a heavy rain poured down, making my climbing plan impossible. While I was preparing
for the review session in my seat, Xinyi was called by Mr. Huang again. Recently, the discussion frequency
with Xinyi was much higher than usual, which made him tired. When Xinyi came out, he seemed not be the typical
type, cynical towards difficulties ahead. Without calling us for a supper, he disappeared with his production tool
(ipad) at the corner of the entrance of lab2c.</p>
