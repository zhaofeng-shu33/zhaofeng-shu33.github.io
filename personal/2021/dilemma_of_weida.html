	<h1>The dilemma of Weida</h1>
<p>2021/5/15</p>
<p>There were only two weeks before the deadline of NIPS, a top conference of artificial intelligence.
Weida is supposed to submit a paper to this conference, but his progress is slow.
He devoted much time in conducting simulation but had difficulty to achieve good results for
real world dataset. This was expected. Jian Xu also said he preferred research style starting
from application problems and developing new algorithms which perform well. Theoretical explanation
is not so important for him. However, the team of Mr. Huang reverted this process and tries
to verify their theory in practice. The difficulty of Weida was not only limited to his unskillful
performance in coding, but also bad time schedule. For example, he didn't start writing the paper
until now.
Seeing this, Xiangxiang decided to push him for a better time arrangement.
So Xiangxiang asked him to release his plan on how to finish the paper.
Unfortunately, Weida slept over the whole evening and replied to the request the next morning.
I think Weida faced a dilemma, and he was not sure whether he could finish the paper.
He had missed the last top conference a few months ago when Fei Ma complained that
he could not achieve good experiment results using the model of Weida. Now another turning
point comes. Based on historical observation, Jian Xu commented the research projects
guided by Mr. Huang had never been published in top conference of AI. This fact may reflect
that the wrong research direction is chosen. So could the team of Mr. Huang break the 
spell by the chance of NIPS? It depends on the works of Xinyi and Weida.</p>
