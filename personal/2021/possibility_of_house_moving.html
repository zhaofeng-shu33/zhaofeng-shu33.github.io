	<h1>Possibility of house moving</h1>
<p>2021/3/9</p>
<p>Sun Meng, one of my junior and high school friends, emailed to me that
she felt much stress when she heard the good results of college entrance exam
of our high school that year. The information is that two students entered
into Tsinghua University. I searched this news and found that one was learning
art while the other was talent student in sports. Probably they were not this
year's graduates. In the mind of local people, only those students who entered
Tsinghua with solid scores deserved good reputation. It was quite rare for
my hometown.</p>
<p>I recalled my contact with one study elder sister, Yanqiu Long, who was admitted into
Tsinghua six years before me. Our contact was light due to age difference.
I also recollected my interaction with one study younger brother, Yan Yue, who
was admitted six years after me. Due to the organization of volunteer activities
we messaged each other on wechat. But our contact was also light due to physical
distance. It was so hard to find someone, currently in the same city, with the same
age, coming from the same hometown and owning similar academic degrees.</p>
<p>Last time I met my parents in Guangzhou, they were discussing the possibility
of renting a house there. If it became true, I did not need to go back to my
hometown in spring festival, which means that I was totally cutting off physically
from that small town. Many of my friends before university found their jobs in
Shandong province, influenced deeply with the thoughts of keeping near with hometown.
Only a small part of my high school classmates chose to live in big city outside of
Shandong province. Most of them were in Beijing, which will also become my destination city in the future with high probability. But they were not the group I were
familiar in middle school. Only because of the same origin can I have enough
motivation to make contact with them again.</p>
<p>In retrospect of history, intellectuals are also faced with departing with
a familiar environment and setting in a new environment. It became really hard
for them to reunion with old friends. In modern time, technology does not
solve the problem. It needed both time and money to move a person from one place
to another remote place. It is expensive therefore deserves cherishing.</p>
