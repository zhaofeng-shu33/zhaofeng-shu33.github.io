<p>My idea plan of preparing for TestDaF is broken by a series of events.
The phone call from Mr Wang, who provides the place for the "return
teaching" activity in my hometown, broke my dream this morning.
He emphasized the importance of obtaining the permission of
higher authorities during this special time when new corona cases appear in 
many domestic places. The head of volunteer association in my hometown,
Yanfeng Wang, conveyed the information of this activity to
the civil administration bureau and the definite answer will
come out tomorrow I think. I told Yang Bai that it is more
possible to receive the negative reply, which is a sad fact but beyond the
control of common people.</p>
<p>Jin Sima was working hard for a research problem, in which I was also
highly involved. We made up many tries but it seemed hopeless to
figure it out. He often interrupts me while I am reviewing german.
And I will have some technical discussion with him.
In his view, there is little hope to be accepted if "we do not have the SDP result".
The submission deadline for ISIT is approaching and it is really hard to make
choices.</p>
<p>My father works in a private company of Guangzhou now. He has found that
there are ads and game promotions popping out in his "surface" (computer).
With the remote control, I helped him to uninstall some malware. It also occupied
some time of me.</p>
<p>Yang Bai pursued her internship in Beijing. I have found it is
hard to keep steady relationship over distance. Recently she made
phone calls to me to tell some stories of hers. She is hard-working
type while I am keeping a leisurely pace.</p>
