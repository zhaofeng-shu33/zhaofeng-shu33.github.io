	<h1>A hard-working student</h1>
<p>2021/5/9</p>
<p>The midterm exam of Probability is approaching. Recently
Xiangyu Chen asked me questions he didn't understand frequently.
As I noticed, he put a lot of time in preparing for such an exam.
The motivation may come from the fact that the instructor, professor
Ye is his mentor. Besides, his basis is not solid, and he worried a lot
for the failing. As observed, he was really hard-working.</p>
<p>This morning, I wanted to figure out the deduction for a typical formula in
gambler's ruin problem. To motivate myself, I made a bet. If I failed to
get the result, I would ban myself not to watch Japanese TV shows or anime
tonight. This method was used frequently in the first season of Dragon Zakura
to motivate the students for a better efficiency. Since I failed to get
the right place, even there was only a slight distance before I could make it,
I determined to follow the bet to undertake my punishment.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning the second class for "quant investment" begins. Yang Bai
came to the class without breakfast since she woke up too late.
Though I was an audit student, I put much attention to the lecture as I think
this topic is important for modern youths. The mind of Yang Bai changed rapidly.
Two weeks ago she said she would try her talent in private fund company in this summer.
But she was not determined. Though praising for the easy understanding of the instructor,
she felt unnecessary to attend the class after some try. As a result, most of the time, she focused on
her draft paper during the class.</p>
<p>The situation for Xinyi and Weida were not better. After receiving the rejection letter from
ICML, Xinyi tended to follow the advice of Mr. Huang to try his luck in NIPS.
On the other hand, Weida will also submit paper for this conference, but he found
difficulty to get good experiment results to support his theory.</p>
