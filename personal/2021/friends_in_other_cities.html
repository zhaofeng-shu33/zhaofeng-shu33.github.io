	<h1>Friends in other cities</h1>
<p>2021/6/14</p>
<p>Recently I heard some stories of my friends in other cities. Xiuzhi Niu still did not
get rid of the depression caused by the broken relationship with his ex-girlfriend.
He even determined to make suicide to release his torture. From the public material of
his ex-girlfriend on zhihu I felt her impatience. She didn't want Niu to bother her
anymore after they split up. But I am not sure whether her narrative was reliable or not.
I think the torture of first love is more severe. For Niu, I hope he could be more mature after
this hard time.</p>
<p>Another short communication happens when Wan Han sent me the link to vote for our high school
physics teacher, Mr. Chen in the competition for the beautiful teachers in the region of Qi and Lu.
From my personal experience, I did not feel Chen qualified for
such a title unless other teachers perform more badly.
But the central point we discussed is on learning of classical language.
I was astonished when I heard that Han dug a new hole for Sanskrit, and her next
goal is ancient Greek. Latin was also her goal though I was not sure whether she started to learn or not.
Inspired by her enthusiasm, I also wanted to learn Latin and Sanskrit next semester. A
few days ago when the course information of the next semester was released, I investigated it carefully
and found that Latin and Sanskrit courses are hold in the evening, which was not in collision with my
internship. Han treated learning classical languages as her hobby, since her research was not related with
such skills. In my current view, Han is special to me in many aspects. As I grew older, I found
I lost contact with many good friends in childhood and adolescence. The main reason I think is that
the mismatch of academic background. The physical distance is a minor factor. I meet my current friends
only after I became a PhD student. In this sense, Han is special since she is both my good friend in adolescence
and equivalent personality in her academic study. A second aspect comes from our shared hobby in language
and literature. During our remote communication, she also showed some tendency for Confucianism though I was not sure for her actual knowledge on this topic. On the third one, 
there were dubious relations between us until she formally broke up on the eve of my graduation ceremony.
Because of the third point, her boyfriend strongly opposed to our meeting last year when both of us were locked
in hometown. It seems that on this matter she disagreed with her boyfriend, and they had some quarrel at that time.
When Yang Bai said that she would like break up with me two weeks ago, my mind was in a huge disorder.
I considered a lot of possibilities. One of them was to seek the comfort from Han. From my knowledge,
her boyfriend pursued PhD study in Hong Kong while she was in Shanghai. So it was not possible for their physical meeting for a long time. This situation is advantage for me. Another method was to try my best to regain the heart
of Yang Bai. I even drafted my plan when I was lying in bed. But I did not find enough incentives to step forward.
So I decided to wait quietly, and did not take any active actions at that time.</p>
<p>Tonight, when I read the blog of Hu Yinglin, a professor on the field of science history, I found he was
once discriminated by some humanity group when he was a doctor student. The reason seemed to be related with
his problematic mentor --- Wu Guosheng. According to the wide-spread narratives, Wu abandoned his wife and son
, who was in sick-bed at that time. Then Wu remarried with a female doctor student, who also majored in
science philosophy. Does it comply with the ethic in modern Chinese society? I think the answer is actually not.
When we declared that science and technology alienate people from virtues, we suddenly found this kind of
alienation also happens in the group of people studying humanity. Then it is not a problem of whether one
knows much about humanity, but about which kind of strength can win in the battle of decision: human nature
for oneself or the nature for others.</p>
<p>Two days ago when I ate together with Kong Deqiang, he told us the difference between getting a job
and getting a girlfriend. "When you have a better opportunity, you can change your job. But
when you encountered a girl you liked more than your current girlfriend, you can't change your girlfriend.
They are different because the latter involves the ethnics."</p>
<p>So from my side, I did not think I would ever become the first to break up the relationship with Yang Bai.
And it is also necessary to be available when I was needed by her.</p>
<p>Tonight, Xinyi Tong suddenly told me that he would apply for the Japanese N1 test.
He explained his motivation, "I wanted to experience the feeling of exam."
"But you would definitely fail if you did not prepare for the level of N1." I said to him.
"It doesn't matter. I heard that only 30~40% students can pass the test. So let me become
the denominator of this ratio." He replied. "Then you have a new nickname --- '童分母'." I joked.</p>
