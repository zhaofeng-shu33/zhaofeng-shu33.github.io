# First day of practice
2021/6/30

Today is my first day of internship.
The pace is quite dense as there were two
working meetings for me to join. By
the end of this day, I got more familiar
with the project I'm involved.

Apart from work, I met my old friend Zhenyu Ming,
who also worked as a trainee here. He told me
he had obtained the offer of his department.
The only regret is that he should work at Shenzhen.
