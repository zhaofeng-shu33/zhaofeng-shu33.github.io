	<h1>Printing more books</h1>
<p>2021/5/3</p>
<p>This afternoon, Xiangxiang came to the lab with some fruits for us.
He lived in the nearby Pingshan village of the campus, so that it
was convenient for him to buy fruits or other daily necessities.
When we ate the fruit hors d'oeuvres, five printed books were fetched
by Weida. It turned out to the series of Information Theory lectures.
Obviously only Xiangxiang was willing to read such tough books. On
his desk were always several mathematical books. "I told the staff
of printing shop that the page number should be on the outside, so
I will check it now." Xiangxiang explained to us the special consideration
when putting an electronic book to printed one while turning over the pages
of the fresh book. The staff could not be too careful to avoid mistakes,
since there were some many pages in total. Xiangxiang erased his identity
on the cover of mail by an eraser, and I found his virtual name was related
with Euler. "It is not a new knowledge." Weida commented, "Check his wechat
id and you found it encodes the Euler formula."</p>
<p>During the vacation of Labor's day, I spent more of my time learning Japanese.
After a long sleep,
I found a wechat message from Xinyu Tian. He told me that he had some ideas to
the problem I introduced to him two days ago. So I invited him for a discussion
immediately. Inevitably, I talked much during the discussion while he was listening.
I found he was not polite at the end of the meeting. When I asked his permission for
sending him my research note, he declined directly, which made me quite embarrassed.</p>
<p>On the first day of May, we ate outside with our big brother Xinyu Liu, who is
a post-doctor in our lab. The place we chose was a famous beef hot-pot brand in the
mall of Baoneng, three subway stations from our campus.</p>
<p>Since Xinyi always came to the lab at around 4 in the afternoon, with a dessert
from food delivery platform. He often argued with me on the topic of ancient China.
He emphasized the importance of archeological pieces while neglecting the values of
literatures handed down from generation to generation. I hold the opposite
view. Besides, Xinyi has many distinct hobbies like reading online literature,
politics in Japan and Taiwan and deduction the place from pictures. I have no
interest in all of these matters. "That's so different that both of you will have fans
if you introduced your daily life on bilibili platform." Weida commented.
For me Weida thought the most distinguished characteristic is "polyglots".
"Once I introduced my nearby students to my family. It includes Xinyi and you.
For you I thought a consistent description. To peep the diary of Feng in his workstation computer, you need to use
a Russian keyboard to login to a operating system with german language. Then you have to use Japanese input method
to search the document. Finally you found his diary was written in English."
Weida told me, when we three were eating together at the Canteen of Lotus 1.
Though the description terrified people, the truth is that my French and Russian are not good enough.
To balance the learning of Japanese  and the research, I already found the difficulty. The truth is, when I
was exhausted spiritually, changing the occupation does not work.</p>
<p>During today's supper, I mentioned many friends in my wechat moments showed their marriage scenes or joined
the marriage ceremony of their closed friend. I invited Xinyi and Weida for my marriage in the future,
and Xinyi made a corresponding promise. "Even if I were abroad, I would come definitely." He said.
"But you could not stay overseas at that time." I made such a claim from Xinyi's future plan, which he told us in
the past. The friend who was most related to me was Weijia Wang. He was my high school classmate, who made a marriage ceremony in our hometown. My high school Chinese teacher, other classmates attended this ceremony.
All of these moments made me wonder my coming life. As a fourth year phd student, most of my friends
have entered into career life, since they at most obtained the master degree within three years. Some of them considered marriage, buying cars, investment in stock market and other practical problems. Under such circumstance, it became really hard to focus
on the work, which was merely a type of earning one's living. Yang Bai once described her state mind
as "a worker" when she came to her temporary living room after finishing her internship in the evening.
In her mind, there is little difference between a man sending food and drinks, hired by food delivery platform,
and an engineer who sat in the office, since both of them are working for their livings.</p>
