	<h1>Give lectures</h1>
<p>2021/4/26</p>
<p>Another Monday comes, and we gathered for the lectures of large deviation theory.
Today's lecture was given again by Xiangxiang. There are five audiences every time.
One is the teaching assistant Xinyi Tong. The other four includes Xinyu Tian, Runpeng Yu,
Weida Wang and I. Xinyu Tian was a strange person. As a first-year student, he chose this
difficult course. I never spotted him discussing with others but he always gave accurate
comments on some problems. Therefore, he must be a type with solid math background.
Runpeng Yu is a polite student. He called doctors, "Study brother". I think this form
of address is not suitable for Weida Wang, since they are of the same year.
He worried of his research products because his recent research topic did not go smoothly.
"Mr. Huang thought extra check digits in the representation of images can improve the feature extraction.
Xinchun Yu and I focused on this path to design new architecture of neural networks.
However, both our experimental exploration and theoretical justification failed until Xiangxiang helped us.
He told us a simple model to describe the channel in information theory, so we can focus on it." From his
introduction, I though Mr. Huang still though information theory was a key to the mystery of neural network.</p>
<p>Back to the lecture, Weida Wang came the last, with his breakfast in hand. Xiangxiang always used the
white board to write math for the lecture, instead of any electronic devices. Strangely, this time he
was unlucky. Mr. Huang criticized his style of lecture, thinking his style makes novices in related
field shrink back. During this criticism, Mr. Huang justified his teaching styles of copying lecture
notes by hand. "You won't die if you write two more English words. However, you only write math symbols
on the whiteboard, which makes students confused if their minds are absent. Besides, you only mention
the important contents once, and don't emphasize it. What's more, you seldom explain the insights beside
the theorems and conclusions. Your style is like group meeting instead of giving lectures. That's why
the teaching score of Yuri (an MIT professor) is not high." Under such severe criticism, Xiangxiang
had nothing to do but to accept. Due to this kind of interruptions, we didn't have the class break this
time. Still, the lecture could not be ended after 12:15. The information brought to us by Xiangxiang
is always larger than the normal lecture given by Mr. Huang.</p>
<p>Xiangxiang doesn't eat lunch for a long time. So we headed to the Canteen of Lotus 1. I asked Ruipeng
whether it was accepted for his mentor in Huawei if his paper could not be published, since he had spent
half a year there. Ruipeng explained: "It's ok since there are many trainees. Several of them will more or less
have some products." I think the same situation applies for Mr. Huang. The temper of Mr. Huang becomes bad
when there is few research products by his team. As a result, we flattered each other as the VIP for the
next important product of Mr. Huang. Weida showed his humility towards such flattery: "My experiment was
still not good now. The VIP should be reserved for Fei Ma."</p>
