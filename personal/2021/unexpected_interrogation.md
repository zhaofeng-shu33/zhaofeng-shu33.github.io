# Unexpected interrogation
2021/2/25

I hesitated and wondered whether I should go to the shared class, "A Brief History of Science", because I did not feel well. Maybe sleeping in the dormitory is
not a bad choice. But finally I determined to go, after a nap on the desk in my dormitory.
Riding on a shared bicycle and putting it in the specified region at the destination,
I was still faced with a warning to be punished financially. Nevertheless, it saved some hard time since I felt itchier when I walked on foot. The classroom is
located in the main building of HIT. It is not a big room and 
to my surprise, the professor is female. I accidentally chose a front seat, which
was nearer to the blackboard. It seemed that the professor made herself up carefully,
such that it became easier to draw the attention of students. At first, I was
stunned by a series of multiple-choice questions which seemed philosophical.
But it became easier when the topic transferred to the part of some general humanity interrogation. The professor emphasized a large majority of modern Chinese
vocabulary comes from Japan in early 20th century such that ancient
Chinese writings are sometimes misinterpreted. For example, the word "经济"
in ancient China is unrelated with the concept of economics, but deals with
the ambition to administer the state and relieve the suffering of people.
For the word "科学", there were competitive Chinese translations at that time such as 格致, which is more native and still used in Hong Kong. We have to admit that
by borrowing the words from Japan we can learn western elements quickly but lost
the cultural agreement.

The professor Huang also stressed that her class was not a common science lecture.
"You can always learn common science online. But you can only learn to think
differently by taking some class physically." She uses this summary as a reply
to the anticipation of the undergraduate students who chose the course.

During this general introduction lecture, she gave us an overview picture of
the most important events in science history and multiple perspectives to understand
these events. As a concluding remark, she said, "The wheels of science history head forward, while the political history
sees itself over endless circles."

Finally, beyond the contents of class, she gave some other thought-provoking instances. "Most of you will become technicians in the future. But whether you
are workers (in Chinese '打工人') depends on yourself." She draws the famous
four quadrant golden rules (split according to importance and urgency) and said
to us, "The most important task of humanity education is to enlarge the weight of the world, labeled with 'important but not urgent'."

I think my decision to come for the first class is rewarding. Professor Huang
did not give answers to questions but led us to think for them. At least it
waked up a little of my passion in early undergraduate time. Though I was involved
in a series of "important and urgent" decisions and tasks, I still appreciate
such kind of education and the summons of humanity.

On the way back to the lab, I gradually thought over my self-organized qualification
exam and my struggle with inflammation. As Yang Bai said, both of us will experience
a hard time until the future job is determined. All we could do is to cheer each
other up and bravely face the difficulties.
