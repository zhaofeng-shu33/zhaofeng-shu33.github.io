	<h1>The review session of Probability</h1>
<p>2021/4/29</p>
<p>To help students prepare for the midterm exam of the course Probability,
I applied for a review session with 2 class hours. The session was held in today's
evening, just after the
10th lecture in the afternoon. Before this session, I had never delivered
speech on math problems in English, though both Weida and Xinyi had already
such opportunity to practice their spoken English in math-related expression.
When I heard the lecture delivered by Professor Ye, I found it was so clear
that I thought it was easy. However, when it came to my turn. I found my mouth
was stubborn. How to express 2^3 in English? I was in loss when writing such
expression on the whiteboard. After class, I searched online and found the
answer was "2 to 3". Though I prepared for a lot of exercises, finally I found
my speed was quite low, and I only finished about 30%.</p>
<p>Zhiyuan and Weida often discuss a mobile game called “Arknights”, which is
two years old recently. Zhiyuan spent more than a thousand Yuan on this game
while Weida spent nearly two hundred Yuan. On the contrary, Xinyi did not play
mobile game while sticking to computer game. The game he often plays
is called “GuJian”. He also spent much money on his favorite game.
Another hobby shared by Weida, Guodong and Zhiyuan is to play “Honor of Kings”
together. It is also a very popular mobile game in China.
For their teams there is even a Beijing group while they are Shenzhen group.
The Beijing group consists of members like Rui Ma, once phd student supervised
by Professor Yue Wang and Ning Liu, who is current phd student under the
same mentor. Zhiyuan and Guodong are remotely supervised by this mentor.
As can be seen, the research group becomes a team who plays mobile games
together.</p>
