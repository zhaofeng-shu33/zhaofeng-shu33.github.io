	<h1>Visiting library and others</h1>
<p>2021/2/19</p>
<p>Yesterday I went to Sun Yat-sen Library of Guangdong Province. It is a provincial
library with old building from the time of Republic of China. When I arrived here
at about 5 pm, some services, including foreign language book reading room, were closing their doors.
I went through the bookshelf of chinese periodicals, which was situated on the third floor.
The extent of journals here is more comprehensive than that in university town.
The reading desks were almost fully occupied with young people, including pre-university students
doing their winter holiday homeworks. The second floor is devoted to the chinese books. Due
to space limitation, only literature and history books are served in the reading room while
other genres are placed in an inner room, in which people can search the book they want but can not
sit down for reading purpose. The public activities recently are mostly targeted towards children.
The reading room for chinese newspaper is located in the ground floor. In this room there were
mostly elder people. Walking out of the building, the sun had not set yet, and I could see the
lawn mixed with golden color. The unusual quietness formed a sharp contrast with the various sound outside
of the yard. A middle-school student was finishing his supper in a corner of the main building.
Obviously he would pursue his study in the library afterwards. But I could not linger,
review tasks for the language exam were waiting for me. Also, it was already time for a dinner.</p>
<p>After going back yesterday evening, I found my mother was not comfortable. It seemed that
she had a fever, caused by swollen teeth. She was afraid to have a check in the hospital,
in fear that any patient with a fever should be isolated during this special period.
But I think eating drugs only have minor effect for her recovery. I still had nothing to do
with the condition of my mother, so I went to the bedroom to continue my study.</p>
<p>My times of dress changing has been used up. So new issues by the doctor are needed for the continuation. The semester will begin formally the next week so I plan to go back this Sunday
evening and continue my dressing in the health center of Shenzhen.</p>
