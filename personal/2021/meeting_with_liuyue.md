# Meeting with Liu Yue
2021/7/18

Time flies and it has been twelve years since I met her last time.
By accident, there was an opportunity to meet her.
The place we chose was near to her living position. It was called Chaoyang Joy City.
It took 80 minutes from my lab in Luomu Building to this place mainly by subway.
Before I went there, I often wondered why Liu Yue left a deep impression on me
though we had only restricted connection in times of junior school.

So I read through all diaries of that time. Some paperback diaries were probably
lost when I scanned the remaining last year. From my handwritten 
feelings and the restructured narratives of Qzone articles, I only had two
major encounters with her. One is focusing on changing seats, happening several times
under different circumstance. The other is her copying of my homework.
The stories mainly happened in Junior One, though I had mentioned her name in other stories
of Junior Two. The impression she left on me was that she was rude and aggressive.
I even called her "Female Tiger" in my diary. Then she disappeared in my life when we changed
class in Junior Three. I never met her in Senior school, so I guessed she failed to be admitted
into the Eastern part of First Middle School.

With all those wonders I departed and lost in thoughts in subway.
What was her life in these 12 years? Why she chose the seat on my side at Junior One?
Would she really go back so to hometown for her future career development?
With all those wondering I was approaching the destination.

Chaoyang Joy City was a shopping mall, so big that I could not find the Nayuki's tea easily.
The promised time had passed a little, and I was anxious to be late. As a result, I jogged on
the first floor until I realized that I headed towards the wrong direction.

Finally I reached it. Small rain drops slowly from the sky. It seemed to be evening though
it was actually noon. I did not know the weather outside during the one hour's riding underground.
Is she already here? I hurried into the place and found some girls sitting quietly.
But I could not make sure whether she had come or not. After twelve years, I could not
figure out clearly what she really looked like. So I sent her a wechat message to notify my arrival.
She replied that she had just arrived in a nearby parking plot by electric motorbike.
Since I was earlier, I ordered two soft drinks and waited for her quietly.

She wore a kind of queen dress, and greeted me when she entered the store. We chose a place to recollect
our shared memory and friends. Such kind of meeting is relaxing since it was not focusing mainly on the future development
of each individuals, but it was also intensive since it contained a lot of new information.
Liu Yue told me that she was familiar with this place as she often negotiated with her colleagues here.
I guessed she referred to some kind of online meeting since she also told me that her current company
was far from here (about 1 hour commute time). Anyway, the place was quiet, especially on the second floor of this store.
I even felt the soft rain dropped to my heart as our joint recollection hit some forgotten memory of each other.

I was astonished to realize that she was also in the literary club hold by Wang Han. "Maybe due to some reason, I quitted in the midway."
She said. Indeed, what she said was not a lie. As I showed her my articles assigned for the club, she said she seemed to have read
the assigned topic called "new stories about twelve zodiac signs". But after I went back to my lab, I checked the addressee
of the assignments, only six addresses are left. It did not include her name. I inquired Wang Han for this matter online and she said
it was probably due to her unwillingness to write articles furthermore. The excuse of Wang Han was plausible. As Liu Yue described herself
today as "full of ambition but lacks the continuous action power." In other word, she was not diligent enough to achieve her goal.
It was not her fault but the weakness of humankind. Anyway, on the spot I said to her honestly,
"Sorry for my forgetfulness of your presence in the literary club, but I only remembered six students including me,
Chen Wei, Wang Han, Zhang Xiaoyu, Chu Chenyu and Shi Zhen."

"Never mind. What I wrote at that time was just piling up splendid words. It was heavily influenced by the romantic novels I read,
such as works by Guo Jingming."

The past was always interweaved with the current state. As I told her honestly that the impressions she left on me during my Junior time
were always negative, she smiled and expressed her sorriness for such a bad figure. "Indeed, I would not copy others' homework now.
Human changes gradually." She explained.

"That is! For me I wouldn't be against the copier either." Then I told her my experience as the teaching assistant,
and my attitude change towards the plagiarism. As I was talking, I felt the surrounding world was rotating.
Actually we sat face to face surrounding a round table in one direction. But I sensed the direction had been changed by 90 degrees
due to the rotating effect. That was probably caused by my long time disguise as a social man instead of a boy with a pure heart.

The milk tea on my side was consumed faster than that of Liu Yue. I felt I had sucked all the water, and only thick cream
was left. Originally I was a little hungry since noon was my biological time to eat. But after finishing the milk tea,
I felt a kind of full stomach. Fearing of passing the time of lunch, I reminded Liu Yue for eating.

But before we left the store of Nayuki, we had already exchanged quite a lot information on different topics.
As youth of the same age, both of us felt the elapsing of the adolescence, and the two tough problems in front of us: job and romantic
relationship. I summarized the two topics here, regardless of their actual sequence within the long talk.

Liu Yue was much earlier than me when she tried her first love in senior school. The environment played a dominating role.
She went to Western Past of First Middle School, where the regulations were looser than its eastern counterpart.
I explained to her that in East School, teachers are putting heavy surveillance on the problems of early love.
Any sign of flame of early love was extinguished immediately. As a direct result, the relationship of students in Eastern School became
much more practical. Anyway, on the side of Liu Yue, she was more free to try something new while she had some determination to
go out of Shandong Province. After some careful consideration on the side of herself and her family, she applied for the exam of
art on the subgenre of creative writing. At the same time, her final grade of College Entrance Exam was not bad. As a result,
her undergraduate university outperforms many students in Eastern School including that of Wang Han.

"But there is also some side-effect of immersing myself in creative writing." She sighed while recollecting the sad story of her
impulse to make up a story for the composition part in Chinese exam of Gaokao. "Without any suspense, I had the lowest score among the major three subjects."

"That's true. It is much harder to write a narrative than writing an argument essay for the purpose of exam." I replied to her old regret.

Since Liu Yue had experienced love in high school, she did not feel eager to get rid of the single state in campus. This mindset
lasted until last year when she fall in love with a stranger at first sight.

"For almost seven years I kept single and refused the worshipper by pretending that I was not single. This state was broken one day
when I met a man in high-speed rail."

"So you behaved active to approach him?" I interrupted her.

"That's true. But after this unsuccessful relationship, I thought it was better for girls to be passive."

I guess what she said was sometimes contradictory. I also heard the statement that "I will not hesitate if I met someone again who
makes my heart palpitate" and "I will immediately return to his hug if he was single again." The referrer "he" was his first boyfriend 
in high school. In retrospect, Liu Yue was more emotional than rational. After so many years, she still lives in a true state with less
disguise than surrounding colleagues.

"My rank was lowest in my group. So sometimes I need to order coffee during meeting. Once a senior colleague joked on me for this kind of errands, 'Hey, Xiao Yue, do you feel yourself like a maid for our boss?' I immediately revoked him, 'Not at all. I only finish what I should
do in career. It has nothing to do with maid.'" Liu Yue told me this choking story, full of the smell of gunpowder. I can imagine
the face of her at that time vividly.

Her domain was making movies or web series. From her isolated description, I guess she was in charge of the scripts of the artistic product.
It indeed needs a lot of imagination and writing skills. "When I were secure with a position in hometown, I would start my
side occupation. It should be writing scripts. Maybe I could make some money. Then I can travel a lot of places."
She mentioned "money" here, and she also mentioned her initial plan was to earn 1 million RMB before she could come back
to hometown in silken robes. As one famous sentence goes, "富贵不归故乡，如衣绣夜行，谁知之者？" which was quoted in one selected article
of my high school Chinese textbook. Liu Yue felt much more intensive yearning for the hometown than mine. On one side,
with salary about 200,000 RMB a year, the consumption is also huge. Hard to accumulate money for employees from other provinces.
On the other side, "After the passing away of my grandmother, I suddenly felt I had less time to accompany my parents. Maybe it's
time to come back. My heart told me that. I should follow my heart."

Actually her plan has already been carried out. Last week she finished the writing examination of civil staffs in my hometown.
This Friday she applied for another exam in Taierzhuang. The annoying part was that
the application needs physical affirmation. I had heard about this regulation before and thought it was really inconvenient
for examinees from other places. But to get such a ticket, you had no way but to obey the absurd rule. Luckily it was near
to YiCheng, Lui Yue can ask the help of her sister to drive her there. But I still think taking the high-speed rail to and fro
within a single day for a sole purpose of application was a helpless choice.

But Liu Yue was not decisive enough for a single purpose. At the other end, she could not easily abandon the dream to stay
in big city for a longer time. "I had gone through two times the graduate entrance exam for Beijing Film Academy. The second
time I had a narrow distance to the admittance in the interview round." But she failed again. Then she had to take her age
into consideration. That's reality. So she became hesitated whether to try again. She knew to win the competition,
she needed to be much more focused than her current state.

Whatever to say, she seemed fragile now, and I did not think she had the strength to beat boys in her current state.
As she told me, the load of jobs made her weak, especially when she needed to stay up late regularly.
"Now I had an imminent operation next week in one hospital of Beijing. One of my parents will come here to look after me."
不治将恐深, it may be another reason which makes Liu Yue feel more urgent to return to hometown.

So what kind of partner does Liu Yue really want? It was indeed not the type whom her relatives introduced to her a month ago.
She was independent on such thing. "If I became successful in career, it wouldn't be a problem to be reminded to consider marriage."
What she said was true, I replied her that your relatives were harder to find counterpart for you once you become quite rich.
But from her emotional characteristics I don't think she was willing to keep single for a whole life. For a short time she was unwilling
to compromise for the unromantic marriage and live together with someone who she does not like so much but with the essential capital
to root in Beijing: house and family register. On the contrary, I expressed my undergoing compromise for romantic relationship.
On one hand, it was risky to break up with my current partner and seek others while it was unmoral to keep the relationship while
undertaking intimate communication with the hidden partner stealthy. On the other hand, I can still found many other touch and joys in my friend circle, in my interest circle and so on. Liu Yue disagreed with me, "Human is the most interesting creature to play with. I can not endure
the life when I see someone I dislike every day." It was really a hard problem.

As for career development, Liu Yue had changed a job three years ago. By now she became tranquil with her current situation.
"No need to burn yourself for the praise of your boss. The most important instrument is yourself." I guessed that she need
the push from other colleagues before she could really finish something. After her body became weak and her mind of returning
became determined, the tiredness became more obvious.
As for myself, in the company I often felt tired in the last part of the afternoon working time. After the initial fresh feeling, my strength
of keep high-productive became weaker and weaker. Maybe I also needed some external push before I could made some results.

"So how about your friend circle in Beijing?" I was curious about this question since I was wondering whether it was possible to establish
some new intimate circle in my future after stepping into the society. Her answer seems contradictory. I guess she was not satisfied,
and it sounded plausible. Actually she cherished the friendship of colleagues of her first company. At that time, she showed more
sincere and easy to get along well with surrounding ones. But it was impossible to reproduce such a circle when she was at her current company.
Some of her good friends went outside to film new products. "To be honest, most of them were born in Beijing, they belong here while I am not.
Nearer to them makes me think more about the problem when I should go back."

Though the above two topics took a long time in our communication, we also fill the gap with some old memory. About some
stories and friends in adolescence.
The problems are that these old parts have less connection with the current situation, let alone with the future.
To be worse, the nostalgic feeling can even hinder the concentration on current problems. I guess someone thinks it is a kind of wasting time.
Professor Ye Min once used Markov's Chain as a metaphor to emphasize that incidents which occurred long ago have weaker and weaker connection
with your current achievement. So do not indulge yourself into the pride feeling of winning the ticket of admittance into Tsinghua.
I think his underlining meaning was pointing to the fact that many
alumuni of Tsinghua University were quite common.
After some consideration, I think treating personal history is similar to the attitude of treating national history or world history.
I was not targeting for some individual highlight time but the shared memory among people. It is this shared memory which united us
together. Then human becomes less lonely.
