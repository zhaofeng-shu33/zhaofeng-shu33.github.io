	<h1>Changing mentors</h1>
<p>2021/5/14</p>
<p>Jian Xu is not satisfied with his current relationship with Mr. Huang. As he said,
he did not like the research topic Mr. Huang allocated for him. The ideal situation
for him was to conduct independent research he has interests and publish as many
papers as possible. This is a realistic view of him. According to his standard,
the lab of my girlfriend is more suitable for him, since the senior professors there
did not guide students by themselves. The goal of Jian Xu is also simple, try to
get the national scholarship next year. He has never earned this title before, so
he wants to give it a try. By accident, he knew Yang Bai was my girlfriend,
and by his wonderful survey ability of girls, he linked her with the outstanding
student who has published three papers on top conference, and expressed his
admire for her achievement. As he stayed longer in our lab, his mind changed and
tended to be the one who does not like the research style of Mr. Huang.
Maybe such change gives enough explanation on why he didn't attend the course of
large deviation except for the first one. Jian Xu said, "I liked the research area where I
could publish papers easily and helpful for my future career. In such measure, information measure
is not helpful and even useless."</p>
<p>Compared with him, Yi Yan was more easy-going. He did not have great ambition
to compute with others in academic domain. Recently he made acquaintance with
her current girlfriend by the go-between, Yifei Zhu, and he felt satisfied.
To his contrary, Jian Xu had no great interests in seeking a girlfriend at current
stage. He thinks more on personal success and holds several hard requirement
for his future partner.</p>
