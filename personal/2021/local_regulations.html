	<h1>Local regulations</h1>
<p>2021/1/28</p>
<p>To my surprise but also plausible, my hometown has strengthened the anti-virus measures.
One of the many regulations stop all offline cram schools. Such regulation makes our
volunteer teaching activity impossible. It became the last straw for me to change my
mind. I decide to stay in Shenzhen and won't go back.</p>
<p>Local regulations are tougher than the suggestions made by upper authority.
Xinyi Tong explained it as “local officials are fearful to lose their positions.”
So one layer above another layer so that the real execution of order becomes strange.</p>
