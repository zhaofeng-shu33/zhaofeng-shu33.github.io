# Inspirations from science history
2021/3/11

Professor Huang summarized many points from the era of industrial
revolutions. It is said that the first industrial revolution
is the most important event in the history of humankind, and
the invention of universal steam engine brings fundamental change
to the structure of industry. On one hand, small handcrafts
face the danger of bankruptcy, which is already mentioned in the 
works of Marx. But we should also notice the enthusiasm for the
perpetual motion machines. We can distinguish three kinds of people
when a new kind of technology appears: those who are afraid, those
who have fantasy and those who are conservative. All of the
three types are oppositional to the promoter of the new technology.
The historical rule tells us only one side holds out to the last
but the advance is made through the interaction of different voices.
For an individual there should be a standpoint, but for the whole
an individual is not so important.

If the first industrial revolution marks the time of freeing people
from simple body labor, then it might be true that the on-going AI will free
people from simple intelligent labor. The labor should be so simple
that machine can learn from experiences. From this sense, AI can be regarded
as the universal source of simple intelligence. Those who expect complex
intelligence from AI is vain, and those who are suspected can not hinder
the progress either.

Another insight comes from the view of "Information and Energy".
No force can develop by itself without standing on the shoulder of the other.
The invention of electric telegraph can not happen without the use of electricity.
The former is a milestone for human to obtain information much more quickly,
while the latter is originally used in energy area.
The same can be said about the information technology in current time. There
is some bottleneck for the carrier of information to shrink its size and
increase its capacity in both computational power and storage. Therefore,
it needs the help from the breakthrough in the field of energy.

Another inspiration comes from the invention of airplane. Someone like
Otto Lilienthal tries to make hundreds of experiments without regard of
scientific principles of flying, while Wright brothers guided their experiments
by the principle of aerodynamics. Analogy can be made for the area of artificial
intelligence. Some intellectuals hold that AI can not make real breakthrough unless
people discover the solid principles behind the phenomenon.

This noon I read over the letters Yang Bai sent to me. In the letter Yang Bai
summarized her values as "tragic life, active experience" (悲剧人生、积极入世)
and seeked my understanding. I thought I shared with her the same values but with
different methods, goals and attitudes. She also sent the book "The Peach Blossom Fan",
published by People's Literature Publishing House.
