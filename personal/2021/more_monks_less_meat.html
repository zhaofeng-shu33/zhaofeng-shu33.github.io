	<h1>More monks less meat</h1>
<p>2021/5/20</p>
<p>Xinyi, Weida, Guodong and I were eating supper in the Lotus 1 Canteen. Guodong complained that
the amount of meat was slim on his plate. I mentioned a four-character idiom called "More monks
less meat" (僧多肉少). Weida felt confused, "why monks are allowed to eat meat? Xinyi thought
there were regional difference when Weida pointed out a similar idiom "More monks less porridge"
 (僧多粥少). Do I remembered wrong? I looked the first idiom online and found an interesting
 explanation. So I told others, "there indeed exists 'more monks less meat', which describes
 the phenomenon in a department of universities when there were more girls than boys."
 "Then how come the monks are allowed to be near the women?" Guodong retorted. He
 also put a third idiom, "more wolfs less meat." Within the topic, Xinyi also made a joke,
 "Weida and Feng, both of you were people already with meat." I felt confused at first,
 and Weida reminded me Xinyi meant girlfriend.</p>
<p>Today is a special day for Chinese youth. Some students will show off their love in wechat
moments while some will eat dog food. The pronunciation of this date in Chinese is similar
to the meaning of "I love you". So traders will utilize this opportunity to increase their
selling scale. In such sense, every few days there are some reasons to buy.</p>
<p>Put the special meaning of the date aside. I explained my understanding on the three similar
idioms. Originally there were only two idioms. One is describing the relationship between
monks and porridge. The other is about wolfs and meat. Both sides have opposite objects.
Within the subculture of youth, especially in campus, girls are often in the advantage side
of keeping a romantic relationship with boys. They were regarded as "meat" in the eye of boys,
which represents "desirable things". However, using wolf as refer to boys sounds barbaric
while the meaning of monk represents the lonely heart of boys. That's why we created a new
idiom "more monks less meat". Initially, some students used it by accident, and it was gradually
accepted and spread.</p>
<p>During the supper, Weida said he had to give up the idea of submitting paper to NIPS 2021 since he couldn't obtain good experiment results
to verify his theory. This process was not smooth. In the morning he found some good and bad news
about his experiments. But he couldn't overcome the difficulties of getting the results which are matched
with the theory.
Xiangxiang once said to Weida that he could not finish more even within several weeks, since then
he could have new excuses to slow down the research progress.</p>
<p>Fei Ma tends to be opportunistic in our lab. He obtained the internship offer of both Alibaba
and Tencent. Therefore, he had to reject one of them. Recently he was also writing a paper submitted
to NIPS 2021 but his method was too simple to be regarded as a major contribution.
This evening he told me that Yang Bai commented on the latest message of Peiyuan Liu in wechat moment.
This comment turned out to be an eager attitude to go to Berkeley for an exchange. Though I disliked
the behavior of Fei Ma, who acted like an informer, I had to admit what he pointed out was a truth.
The minds of Yang Bai change quickly. I guess it was her new ideas when she saw the condition of her peer.</p>
