	<h1>Curiosity</h1>
<p>2021/5/28</p>
<p>Xinyi has revised his paper many times. Every day he worked
beyond eight hours, which surpasses his expectation greatly.
In his ideal routine, he wants to work for three hours every day.
I often eat with him at noon or at supper. Now the thesis
defense for both doctor and master students ended. A month
left, they did not need to focus on their research. As a result, some vanish
in the lab while others were dealing with matters related with the coming job.
For example, room lending, government subsidy application, and so on.
One month left so what could they really do? As far as I can remember,
I spent time in dormitory checking the codes of some old computer games without plan.
Now I realized that such free time period is really precious, and even can be
used to make progress on another foreign language. Recently, I became more well-organized, and did not want to repeat my unplanned exploration as in my last
semester of undergraduate study. Plus the first month of employment, which is
not busy I think, there is around 2 and a half months which I won't have other
great pressures. Thus, I am going to use this time to strength one of my foreign language skills. Yet, there is one year to conduct such plan.</p>
<p>I told Xinyi about my ideas. Xinyi thought one of my advantages is to stick
to some interests. In addition, these interest fields seem quite broad.
As we talked about natural science, Xinyi thought I was influenced by what I read
in childhood. "Since you read a lot in encyclopedia, especially in animals and plants,
you are encouraged to keep a heart of curiosity about the world around."</p>
<p>Yang Bai conveyed similar comments to me this week. She gradually found that
my style of study is different from hers and even from surrounding world in a sense
that I did not study for some visible secular standard while the motivation may comes
from satisfaction of heart in the process of learning. In such sense, I am
a study master while others are fake.</p>
<p>Both of them two summarized their observations which may be neglected by myself.
In my interpretation, it was a growing tree coming from a tiny seed in the past.
On one hand, the tree needs growth to resist the cruel world outside. On the other
hand, the tree has to grow to fulfill the wishes contained in the seed.</p>
