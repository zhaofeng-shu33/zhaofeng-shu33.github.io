	<h1>Friends nearby</h1>
<p>2021/1/15</p>
<p>One night on the bed, I talked with Pengyang Zhao, my roommate about
doctor friends in the lab respectively. Both of us concluded
that doctors tend to play with doctors. In my case, I often eat
dinner with several male doctors like Zhiyuan Wu, Weida Wang and
Guodong Li. We talk freely about the domestic environment, about
the academic study and other interesting topics. It is hard to imagine
time flies that each one of us is destined to leave the campus sooner or later.
Nowadays we often complain about the poor service: no convenience store,
the maintenance of elevators 
and the annoying regulations about entering and leaving the campus.</p>
<p>Yesterday is the first day of winter vacation. Jian Xu had come back that day
but most of us will remain quite late. Some students had no choice since
there are coronavirus cases in their hometown and the local regulations are quite strict. Other students had to meet the academic conference deadline like the top ICML (Feb 3rd). The secretaries of our lab disappeared yesterday, which represented the
beginning of our winter vacation. But our professor, Mr Huang, is diligent and
often enter the lab room to inspect the work of his students.</p>
<p>I remembered the recollection of Asa Huang, a classical Chinese literary professor
in Harbin institute of Shenzhen, told us in the class "Paths to Poetry" that
the careless life has an ending, which is unexpected, but it has an ending.</p>
<p>When I was at campus pursuing the master degree, I always go along with my two
roommates,
also my best friends at that time. We were so happy that we believed that we would
still be good friends after graduation. However, the reality is that even if
we were in the same city, it is too hard to have a reunion. One of my friend
stayed at the Beijing Normal University for doctor degree while I went to Tsinghua.
But we seldom met. After the doctoral graduation, we would part and the reality
is that we became friends of wechat moment. I still remember clearly the
situation when she asked me to give her a dedication to her notebook before I went to Shenzhen. I wrote
down that:</p>
<p>To memorize the best times of our adolescence. (in Chinese, 纪念我们最好的青春。)</p>
<p>She disagreed with my inscription.</p>
<p>"Why the best, do we have less happy times now and in the future? "</p>
<p>I was inspired and watched her cross out the word "best" and changed it to
"beautiful". So the sentence now reads as:</p>
<p>To memorize the beautiful times of our adolescence. (in Chinese, 纪念我们明丽的青春。)</p>
