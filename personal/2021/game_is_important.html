	<h1>Game is important</h1>
<p>2021/5/19</p>
<p>Xinyi came to the lab just before 9 o'clock because he had meeting in the office
of Mr. Huang. Today is Wednesday, so professor Zheng will join the meeting remotely.
Professor Zheng, is the phd mentor of Mr. Huang, and resides in USA.
Jian Xu once commented the regular meeting between Mr. Huang and Zheng is the only
link that our lab has the international cooperation. From the narrative of Xinyi,
both Mr. Huang and professor Zheng insist that Xinyi should submit the paper to
NIPS 2021. I have read this paper yesterday, and thought it was quite good.
There was no wonder for the good quality of the writing, since this paper
was extensively revised by the two professors and Xiangxiang Xu. I think
very likely this paper will be accepted, and the spell of Jian Xu
will be broken.</p>
<p>The situation of Weida was not good. While writing the first draft of the paper,
he didn't abandon the idea to make more experiments. But his programming skill and
the ability to build network are not solid. Xiangxiang did not think high of
the state of Weida. Indeed, he pushed both Weida and Xinyi a lot. I asked why
it happened when we three ate lunch together. Xinyi explained that it was because
Xinyi would leave here soon. His visa is expected to arrive, and once he obtains
the scholar visa, he will fly to MIT immediately. "So after Xiangxiang leaves,
you two will be freed." I suggested. "You are totally wrong." Xinyi retorted,
"then Mr. Huang will push us by himself." I felt surprised to such expectation.
Xinyi then mentioned the diligence of Mr. Huang in his phd time. "He stayed up
late often, and met his mentor almost every day." Now he became professor,
and it's not necessary to work hard as the past. I agreed with such analysis,
and felt worried about Xinyi and Weida after Xinyi leaves.</p>
<p>I mentioned the possibility of arranging a meeting for Xinyi and Jieying,
Xinyi did not refuse directly but postponed it without definite date.
I thought he was not taking it seriously. Recently he was watching
a Chinese TV shows called "In the Name of the People". He told me he finished
almost 10 series each day. Also he plays computer games after returning to
his dormitory in the night. In summary, the first importance is
personal recreation, then is his research. Others can only be put in the third place.
I felt speechless towards his attitude.</p>
