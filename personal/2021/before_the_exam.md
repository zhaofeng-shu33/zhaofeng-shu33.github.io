# Before the exam
2021/3/25

Though the german test is approaching, I devoted most of my time into other
affairs such as scrabbling the answer for second homework of large deviation theory
and decoding the compressed content of wechat database. Both are quite technical
matters.

Yesterday, Xinyi and I went to get our first jab of vaccination.
We were told to sit in nearby places for about half an hour after the jab.
It is said that this time is reserved for observation in case of 
any adverse reactions. There was no queue ahead of us, and Xinyi commented that
students were hesitated about the vaccination.

Last Sunday night I went to the airport to welcome the return of Yang Bai.
She quit his rent in Beijing and determined to continue his intern remotely.
An important cause of her return was to prepare for her upcoming qualification exam.
I accompanied her to the bustling shopping mall (Yifang Center) in Baoan for a supper on our way back to school.
She complained the detour was inconvenient and not well arranged since we brought two big cases
and a heavy bag all the way. It was rush hour. Many popular restaurants were full and the queue was
long. Finally, we found a small brand selling stewed chicken which admitted seat immediately.
The taste was not bad, and the hospitality was pleasing. Most of our talk focused on realistic
issues, and I found the topic was too restricted.
