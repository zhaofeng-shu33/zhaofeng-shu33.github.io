	<h1>Study condition</h1>
<p>2021/7/10</p>
<p>During the summer time, some students left the campus for social practice or returning home.
The open time of libraries is shorten as an adjustment accordingly.
Junior students like to come home while senior ones feel less dependent on the hometown.
Many students like the studying environment of the library since one can feel the
hard-working spirits of nearby people and books. For graduate students with engineering background, a more common choice is their working place in the lab. The fixed place
is not only convenient for research, but also efficient when playing with hobbies.
This week, I applied for a place in the lab of Professor Wang Yue. This small lab
consists of 3 PhD candidates including me, and two master students. Amusingly,
all PhD candidates belong to the students of Professor Zhang Lin, since Professor
Wang has no quota to recruit PhD students. Some students have already graduated and
left the campus. Therefore, I can use the remaining computer for my purpose.
As I can remember, when I first came into the campus, I only had one laptop,
and had to combat with other students for a self-study place in rush hour.
Nowadays, the situation changed. I had two monitors and a fixed place when I didn't
need to perform the internship routine. It is indeed more efficient. But it comes with
some cost. As a senior PhD candidate, I knew few students now, let alone kept a good relationship. Maybe a relatively familiar one is Ming Zhenyu. But I did not have
enough sharing time with him in the past. After the freshness of living here,
I realized the biggest challenge waiting for me is loneliness.</p>
<p>As I grow old, loneliness is unavoidable. But due to some incidents, I was embraced
with Tong Xinyi, Wang Weida and Xu Xiangxiang in my long staying at Shenzhen after the Covid time. The co-occurence had something with the characteristics of Professor Shao-lun Huang,
who insisted on theoretical study while all others focused on practical engineering problems.</p>
<p>When my mentor at Noah's lab invited our four trainees for a dinner, the youngest student
said he would like to meet old classmates this weekend. That is quite common for contemporary
youth. They had much less friends as time passes by. However, I did not know with whom
I should meet in this big city. In fact, I did not feel strong nostalgia feelings towards many of my
old classmates. It may be caused by the fact that there were moving moments between us in
the past. The person I would like to meet eagerly is my sister Huang Dongyu, who worked in Beijing after her undergraduate study. She is one year senior than me, and the elder-sister
title is only to show some intimacy. Though we had only several offline contacts,
the impression she left on me and the help she offered to me made us nearer. In fact,
most of our communication happened through email, and sometimes by phone.
Unluckily, she went away on business in Shanghai for two months, and it was impossible
to meet her in a short time.</p>
<p>After a hard search, I found no proper ones except for Liu Yue. Without her active contact
with me a month ago, I had nearly forgot her. The only impression she left on me was surrounding a series of events of seat-changing. I had to admit the impression was so strong
that I knew nothing about her beyond my little narratives about her. She had a short rest
in hometown this week. Maybe it is possible for a meet with her next weekend.</p>
<p>The two-place romantic relationship started after I flighted to Beijing.
I have to admit that it deteriorates gradually, which is not tightly bound with
the physical separation. In my eye, Yang Bai focuses too much on the personal
success while I focus too much on the personal hobby in her eye. As a result,
we are not satisfied with the important decisions the other made. For her,
she thought it was useless for me to put so much time to learn foreign language.
For me, I did not support her to pursue her American dream with the danger to delay her graduation. The American dream refers to her decision for an exchange opportunity in Berkeley.
This exchange was delayed by the pandemic, and many students of her year had abandoned this
opportunity due to realistic considerations.</p>
<p>Recently, when I visited some places of the campus, I remembered the events that happened in the past vividly. The opportunity for staying half years here is precious after 3 and a half
years resettlement in Shenzhen. The privilege to borrow many books in university libraries
is much higher than that in city libraries. The price of food in the canteen is lower than
outside restaurants. There are so many benefits that one Tsinghua alumnus in my internship group envied the life of living on campus.</p>
<p>The commune between my dormitory and the company is relatively short compared with others.
But the road is full of vehicles and traffic lights. Sometimes it is dangerous to ride
a bicycle in a hurry. Taking a bus often faces the problem of waiting and traffic jam.
Hence the commune time by bus has a large variance while commune by bikes takes
about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>I borrowed the books of Changes, and the Zuo Chronicles to continue my reading
in Five Classics. This plan was started at Shenzhen and I decided to finish it in Beijing.
Besides, I will learn French and Japanese occasionally to continue my foreign language journey.</p>
