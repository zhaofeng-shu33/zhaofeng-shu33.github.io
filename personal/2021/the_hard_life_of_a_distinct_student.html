	<h1>The hard life of a distinct student</h1>
<p>2021/6/17</p>
<p>Zhang Hao is a first-year master student of TBSI. He has a chubby and strong figure.
I heard his story last semester since he performed quite badly in a course
called Information Theory. Xinyi Tong was the teaching assistant of this course.
Actually the grade of Zhang Hao in this course was the last. Though he studied really
hard, he did not understand much. Besides, his mathematical background is weak.
I clearly remembered that he consulted Xinyi for a long time in the evening before
the final exam. I wondered why Xinyi had so much patience towards this incurable student.
Xinyi said, "Since he is very sincere, there is no reason for me to dismiss him thousands away."
Strictly speaking, he ought to fail this course. But Mr. Huang never let students
fail his course. As a result, he only got a low score.</p>
<p>Reality is never like the fable story, and miracle never happens in a short time.
To our surprise, this semester Zhang Hao appeared in the class of large deviation
theory. As an auditor student, he expressed his willing to enlarge his mathematical
knowledge. I was not sure he really understood what was taught in this course.
Using the words of Weida, it is mathematics of graduate level. But Zhang Hao
seemed enthusiastic. He declared that his mentor, professor Qin, admired Mr. Huang
quite much and encouraged him to learn in the class of Huang. Apart from learning
in class, sometimes he came to our lab on the 11th floor to consult Xinyi about
some questions. These questions may seem easy for us since they are only basic concepts in math
but it is hard for him to understand. He never came without some eating gifts.
Once it was a box of cherry, the other time it may be some cakes. I think his
gifts are worth more than his request. After all, he earned little as a master student.
So it seems unreasonable for our doctor students to receive his gifts while selling our knowledge.</p>
<p>Several days ago when Xinyi and I went to the neighborhood of sports center to receive the
Covid 19 test, we met Zhang Hao on the road. He told us some stories in his lab. In his
description, his mentor seemed to be a hungry monster striving for delicious food. And his
students were merely his hounds. When the hounds didn't satisfy their master,
they were beat bitterly. I was not sure whether he exaggerated his tough situation.</p>
<p>This evening Zhang Hao came to our lab again. Xinyi was absent, and he asked the help of Weida and I.
From a large bag, he grabbed some lychees and put them on our table. He complained again that
his boss pushed his student a lot. This time I knew more about the background behind such push
after I viewed the biography of professor Qin. He was 39 years old when admitted as an associate
professor of TBSI last year. Compared to those young and talented professor, his studying period is too
long. I am not quite sure whether the system of "either rise or leave" in Chinese university
applies to his case. But to live better in the future, he works very hard currently. One aspect
is that he pushes students very much. Each day he hosts a group meeting. He even learns technical
details by himself. Supervised by such a professor, Zhang Hao faced high pressure. He told
us that he majored in electronics engineering (producing electronic devices) for his undergraduate study.
After he was admitted by TBSI by national unified exam, he was unluckily enrolled by his current professor.
Though in the center of precise medical science, he was appointed to conduct research in the field of deep learning. I did not understand why he put so much attention on the mathematical formulas of the algorithms
instead of coding. Anyway, he was luckier than Xiong Zhenwen, who was quite old when admitted into TBSI. The most precious gift he owns is his youth.
As a student no more than 23 years old, he has huge potentials after hard work of a few years.</p>
