# Memorial hall of Sun Yat-sen
2021/2/17

This morning after changing my dressing in the hospital, I headed
towards the memorial hall with my parents. On the half way there is
a market selling vegetables. My parents bought some there. "It's cheaper
than those in the supermarket." They said. They also try ordering daily
necessities online. Comparing price and saving money are their habits.
But it is strange to visit the memorial with plastic bags in hand.
The locker did not work unfortunately. I filled the electronic form
quickly and waited my parents in front of the ticket office. For them
it is not a easy task to fill electronic form, so it needs some time.

The memorial hall tells more about the history of the building than
the life of Sun Yat-sen. Still, some new knowledge knocked me when I 
learned about the activities of Sun in Guangzhou. Some generals opposed
to his proposals to conquer the other region by force and the military coup,
led by Chen Jiongming broke out in 1922. To some extend, Sun is a revolutionary 
pioneer as an idealist.

The main building is located in a yard with some old trees. We toke a family photo
in front of the building. I stood in the center, much taller than my parents.
The sun was very bright this noon and it was hard for me to focus on the smartphone's camera.
