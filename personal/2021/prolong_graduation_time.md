# Prolong the graduation time
2021/3/20

My roommate recently complained about his doom future due to the pressure
to prolong his graduation time. The direct cause is the possibility that
he will not pass the qualification exam, which will be held at the end of this month in Beijing.
This possibility comes from the destiny of surrounding doctor students in Shenzhen.
Many of them failed two times before they finally passed. There is
a regulation saying that the application of graduation should be at least
one year after passing the qualification exam. So if my roommate failed this exam,
he would definitely prolong the graduation time. Normally it is five years. But there
is a senior doctor student in the lab of my roommate who had read for almost seven years.
"My mentor was still unwilling for his graduation, though he had published enough papers."
My roommate told me last night. That would probably be the second obstacles of graduating
smoothly.
