	<h1>Meeting the old schoolmate</h1>
<p>2021/5/18</p>
<p>Last week I made an appointment with Jieying Yuan, one of my old schoolmates in undergraduate time.
Originally I contacted her because Yang Bai suddenly wanted to try her ability in the private finance company
shared by her mentor. I immediately realized there were some traps put by her mentor, and it was not
a good idea to go to such a small company. But I could not persuade her to abandon this absurd idea.
Such tough situation reminds me of Jieying Yuan, who works in a big finance company at Futian District.
Since she is professional, Yang Bai probably will listen to her suggestions.
I chose Taixing restaurant as the meeting point, which is near Chegongmiao station.
The meeting was delayed because Jieying Yuan was busy on the first weekend in May.
Finally, we realized the meeting yesterday evening.</p>
<p>Since I finished my undergraduate study, I haven't met Jieying Yuan, who continued her master degree
in Department of Mathematics, Tsinghua University. My slight contact with her was within the major courses,
when we discussed some questions related to the course. Therefore, after four years, I was not familiar with her.
So it was hard to have deep conversation. As worried by Yang Bai, this occasion may be embarrassing when topics
are exhausted.</p>
<p>Before we two departed from the campus, I brought a suit of souvenirs of the 110th anniversary, as a present for Jieying.
Yang Bai and I came around 10 minutes earlier to the spot.
The atmosphere of the restaurant is ok, with yellowish light and quiet place. From the introduction of Jieying,
she is not the type to push herself, as expected by me. She stayed in the company where she received internship and didn't
try other opportunities. In this sense, there was little experience for us two to learn from her. Still, she pointed
out some golden rules in her domain, which was beyond the slick talk of the mentor of Yang Bai.
Yang Bai put forward topics related with our collective memory when we were undergraduate students in the same campus.
As mentioned by Yang Bai afterwards, it was only to avoid embarrassment, since Jieying was not good at chatting.</p>
<p>After about one and a half hour, the meeting was ended, as we found difficulty to continue formal talking.
We said farewells at the entrance of the station. On our trip back to campus, Yang Bai began to worry her papers
for the conference, NIPS 2021. She would have a formal online meeting with collaborators as soon as she went back to her dormitory.</p>
<p>I was worrying about another thing, which also astonished me. "Is it possible for the union of Xinyi and Jieying?"
murmured I in heart. Both of them have undergone the same undergraduate campus and shared similar subject: physics
and mathematics. I could not resist the idea to give them a bridge. After making sure Jieying doesn't have boyfriend
at current time, I recommended Xinyi to her with his photo. Recently Xinyi was busy and pushed hard by Xiangxiang to
revise his paper. I only had the chance to tell him about my schoolmate after 12 o'clock in the evening.
Felt supervised, Xinyi expressed he didn't know how to communicate with Jieying online. Then I felt the difficulty
for them to develop further relationship. But I wasn't willing to abandon. Maybe arrangement of an offline meeting
is better. Then I decided to tell Xinyi my plan tomorrow morning.</p>
