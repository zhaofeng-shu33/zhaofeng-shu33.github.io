	<h1>A new discovery</h1>
<p>2021/5/22</p>
<p>This evening Xinyi said he was pushed by xiangxiang to change
the way of expression in his paper. During the time interval of his
time-consuming work, we chatted leisurely about some broader topic, both in recreational
and serious domains. Xinyi was fond of Chinese and Japanese history. He complained
that it was a pity that he could not take the exam of physics and history simultaneously
in college entrance exam. Then we found the problems in the history exam of the past year to examine.
I thought the problems were easy for Xinyi. As his ability to summarize facts is excellent.
Afterwards he told me a new discovery last night. When he was bored with playing computer games,
he began to think seriously in classical Chinese. The topic he chose is to investigate the
similarities of the foul sentence "fuck your mother" in different dialects of China.
Xiangxiang commented that such point of view had been considered by scholars before.
Xinyi argued that his understanding could not be exactly the same with those of others.
According to his explanations, the key point lies in the verb. In different Chinese dialects
people use different verb to express the same meaning. So it is very likely that in middle classical
Chinese these verbs have the same pronunciation. When descending from generations to generations,
the pronunciations diverge in different regions. In modern time when we try to find corresponding
Chinese characters for these verbs, we are only preserving the new pronunciations. That is,
the character itself does not have the meaning to be used as a verb. For example, "草" or "日"
is used to express the meaning of "入"("fuck"). I think it is a little similar to the concept
called "音読み" in Japanese language. The supervising thing is that Xinyi found the exact
pronunciation of the common verb in middle classical Chinese by some analysis based on his
domain knowledge in phonetics of Chinese. If what he said is true, then it definitely demonstrates
that this kind of expression existed for quite a lot time. Xiangxiang commented that it's
also common in other languages other than Chinese. When we abuse a certain person, human tends to
attack his mother. In this sense, Xinyi was encouraged not
to narrow his eyesight to variations of Chinese language.</p>
<p>Suggested by Xinyi, I found another variation in "Outlaws of the Marsh". It appears in the
third chapter when the butcher Zheng abused Lu Da using "直娘賊". Xinyi claimed that the verb
"直" also has the same origin as the other representations. Jian Xu thought another character related
to this meaning, "肏". Interesting, this character has two different pronunciations. One of the utterance
is just like "音読み" of "草"("fuck"). "I think people created this character to fit their oral language."
Jian Xu said.</p>
