	<h1>Expectation of transition</h1>
<p>2021/1/9</p>
<p>It seems that I followed regular path in recent days but changes are expected soon.
I read selected work of Five Classics and The East Chronicle of Zhou Dynastry. The
Classic of Poetry will be finished in two or three days. But no newer books on Confucian
will be borrowed.</p>
<p>To get some electronic resources, I overlook the copyright issues more often. Such
thing is emphasized by myself in the past two years when I mostly engaged in IT community.
But I have to admit it is really hard to get reference books beyond the IT community.
So I gradually violate the copyright of some book holders to get books via improper ways.</p>
<p>Another change is that I have to focus on the preparation of German language test if I can
succeed to grab for an exam seat on the Monday of next week. I have missed the opportunity
to study abroad for one semester in undergraduate time. It is possible for me to get
post-doctor position in German. But the safest way is to get a job in Beijing after a half year.</p>
