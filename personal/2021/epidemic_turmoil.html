	<h1>Epidemic turmoil</h1>
<p>2021/6/20</p>
<p>Due to the worse epidemic situation of Shenzhen,
graduates here are forbidden to join the celebration ceremony in Beijing.
Xingyu Liu, post-doc staff in our lab, complained that he was unlucky enough
influenced by this policy. He graduated last year, and could not join
the ceremony for two consecutive years. Besides, he just bought the flight tickets
before he received this bad news. This policy also had great influence on me.
I planed to return to the campus in Beijing at the end of this month. According
to the latest policy, it is not allowed. My worry is that living outside is quite
expensive and I had to risk returning secretly. Zhiyuan is also influenced, since
he chose a place in Beijing for his major practice this summer.</p>
<p>I had to reflect on my state mind in the past when I witnessed the trouble
of epidemics in other regions. At those times, I felt lucky since the epidemics
did not bring big trouble for my life. Until now, I suddenly realized that
it is hard for each individual to protect themselves when the big environment deteriorates.
It is always problematic when one is gratified by others' misfortunes.</p>
