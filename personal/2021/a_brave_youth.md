# A brave youth
2021/3/28

Hello, the founder of BSJ Institute. I am a student pursuing my doctor study at Tsinghua Shenzhen Graduate School. One of my study brother forwarded
your latest personal essay on his wechat
friend circle so that I could have known your experiences. I guessed
most readers will support your struggle with improper behaviors
of some institutions, and hope that you could get out of the current trouble
quickly.

Life has many faces. The voice for justice is only one of them. As a
research student, what interests me more is your enthusiasm towards computational physical chemistry. As one anonymous user from zhihu said,
"you are superior to most graduate students", who make their research
for an exchange of a certificate. My major, information theory, is different
from you. But it was not so different. A common point is that practitioners
did not need expensive apparatuses for their research. Besides, I also use
computational cluster for simulation sometimes. Though based on different theory in different domain, I believe many operational techniques are the
same, like how to make parallel computing, how to program in compiled language, and so on.

I found you put some of your research articles in chemrxiv.
In my domain (Electronic Engineering), a similar website called arxiv
is used for preprint. It was sad that some articles were rejected
multiple times and you had no further choice of journal in your narrow
domain to submit other
than putting it in chemrxiv. I had similar experiences for some topics.
There is some contribution in the paper but it is not so large that I could publish somewhere. Since I use LaTeX, it was easier to share the source code of the paper itself.
Alongside all my research manuscripts and simulation code, I put all these materials under my personal GitHub account.

In some sense, I found I was different with other graduate students surrounding me.
They protected their research ideas, code and paper. Within a laboratory, most students
are reluctant to share their results in a reusable way. I dislike such phenomenon but
I had to accept it was common, and I was unusual.

You also mentioned your immature ideas of a utopia academic community. Here I also
want to share some experiences of myself. I was lucky to have one or two
counterparts in my lab. Informally we make up a "SIG" (special interest group) of graduates for information geometry. Sometimes we discuss mathematical problems that interest
us. Such discussion may help little for the paper itself but it improves both
participants spiritually. But I have to admit these kinds of occasions are rare. Most
of the time, the research is conducted individually, and it was hard to communicate technical
problems I encountered with others in simplified language. What is more important, even
students from SIG may not have time to go over my problem. From my current experience,
the successful communication lies at the part when we discuss the basic theory, like
problems in analysis and mathematical proof techniques. In such sense, I thought
it was a little impractical for your idea on how researchers can collaborate. In my
domain, international conference is popular than journals, and the conference provides
the way for researchers to communicate in a physically intimate way (the online conference now reduces the effectiveness of such communication, of course). But to register for an
academic conference an amount of money is usually a priori. This fee, along with the
travel expenses, is not small, and needs to be covered by the institution or some other funds.
Maybe you have already known these kinds of customs of academic research. Then please forgive
me for repetition here.

But I do think the popularization of domain knowledge can be shared among a large interest group.
Though there were official platforms for such purpose, other kinds of strengths are essential
supplements. Some knowledge is hard to get from public regular channel but can be inspired
from private local communications.

I am not good at research and will go to a tech company after graduation. But I once had some
love for natural science, which was not relevant with my major. I thought, to pursue the truth,
besides mathematical deduction and computational simulation, physical laws and experiments
are also important and interesting. When I was third-year undergraduate student, I skipped the math class several times to finish some simple experiments provided by the organic chemistry course. I also chose a theoretical course called physical chemistry, taught by the same teacher of Yigong Shi. But unfortunately, I
got 60 scores at final exams. Almost three years later, I managed to union volunteer associations from five different universities for a project related with care for autistic children. Afterwards, two student leaders encourage me to apply for the ten excellent
yearly graduate in volunteer service domain but I rejected. At that time, I thought lowly of
students who do volunteer work for personal interests. After reading your articles, I had some
new guess. If I applied for such title, maybe I could not succeed, since within
the care project, the Jijing subbranch of Shenzhen graduate school is only a minor 
actor. Instead, such project will reflect the active participants of Shenzhen University, which
may not be liked by judges of volunteer title in Tsinghua universities.

My friend told me not to think badly of others when you knew little. From this sense, the
above guess of the flavor of the judge may not be correct since I never participated in
the competition for the title. There was another case for a volunteer teaching project
in rural area, in which I was the captain. Before the project our team borrowed some robots from a tech company and
managed to bring them to the place where we would go. After the fulfillment of the project, our team joint the
institutional competition of social practice, where most teams visited local companies in different places. Unfortunately we did not get any ranking and scholarship.
Afterwards, I contacted the student who was in charge of the score. He told me the problem lied at the
neglect of some parts. "Your team did not have published enough wechat account articles and published the articles
in other influential platforms. Each extra articles have bonus points. Besides, you did not have made interviews
with local Tsinghua alumni. Then you lose many points." Then I knew my fault as a captain, I focused too much on the actual works. But I wound not like to have the second opportunity for such competition, since I felt tired.

When I read one old article of you, dealing with your opinions to "what kind of students teachers do not like",
I felt some reflection of mine in your description. An ambitious student who suspects his surroundings and not so
compatible with the environment. But it was never extreme. Actually, I had some other minor titles
in graduate unions, and published articles on some ordinary platforms.

All the above paragraphs may lack the logic but expressed what I thought after reading many articles you put
on your personal account. I really appreciate your boldness and the inspiration you brought to others, and wish
you could find your unique way to academic success.
