	<h1>Something went wrong</h1>
<p>2021/3/26</p>
<p>The student sitting on my left is called Weitao Tang. A few days
ago he found he could not log in into the medical reimbursement system of our institute.
He called some secretary for assistant but received no positive reply for the trouble.
I found his problem was common to students who have graduated or are going to graduate.
The web page just refreshes itself if they try to log in. Weitao felt worried since
he was going to hand in the reimbursement materials this Saturday, but he was not sure
whether it would be ok without the declaration in the system. His second inquiry
also allowed no useful information. The secretary was not technician and the job passed
one by one. Then it vanished. Very amazing.</p>
<p>Another trouble happened to me in recent days. One afternoon I found my
workstation could not reach the network. After some initial debugging, I suspected
there were some problems with the physical internet connection point. The network
engineer in the Information Building did not believe in my judgement and tested it
by himself. However, it came with few positive results.</p>
