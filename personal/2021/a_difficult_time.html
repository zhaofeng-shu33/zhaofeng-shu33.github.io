	<h1>A difficult time</h1>
<p>2021/3/13</p>
<p>Tonight I finished the second practice of my academic report, and
the exam is tomorrow afternoon. After this exam, another german language exam
is on the door. Maybe after these two exams can I take a short breath of relief.
But that is also the time I am worried about my summer internship in Beijing.</p>
<p>So during this remaining semester, what else will I do? Probably I will submit
an article to ITW 2021 and learn Japanese, which is broken due to preparation
of german test. Other minor tasks includes the second application of CET 6,
dealing with the aftermath of academic exam. Some undetermined tasks are related
with new research topic, which I had put aside to save time for the academic exam.
I also found I lost some interest to read through the mathematics textbook on
large deviation theory. Besides, I am not sure to which extent I should prepare for the
written exams of the company. Yang Bai put focus on such preparation.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, Xinyi went to Guangzhou for another tour. According to his mind,
"I must hurry up for travel, otherwise I do not have opportunities in the near future."
He had submitted one article to a top conference, and it is quite undetermined for the result.
If I were he, I would definitely be worried about papers all day long and put many efforts
into it. But his mind is open, and he said he did not mind staying for two more years.</p>
<p>Last two nights I read several pages of "The Peach Blossom Fan" and wondered why
some rich intellectuals in ancient China were willing to recruit a whole group of
actors (at least 30) to give a complete show of this work. The show usually lasted
for two days long, which is impossible for contemporary show. The maximum duration
of this work is similar to that for a movie. It allows only several episodes of the work
within two hours. I think one difference lies at the purpose of the show. In ancient
times, the donor does not seek money from artistic show. Nowadays, Art should be
transformed to money. This is the main principle for an art company.</p>
<p>This morning my father came to Shenzhen but he could not enter the campus. The gate keeper
did not give any tolerance to outsiders. When we lost hope, I met my colleague Jiarong Li by accident,
who was driving a car. I requested him to bring us inside. The rigid management of the campus
owner does not win the heart of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>When I was eating in a fish restaurant with my father, my father told me that
his afternoon arrangement was cancelled due to the excuse of the other person, who was a
new lawyer in Futian. I said it was quite normal since my father did not have any positions in his eyes. But my father also showed disdain for his disrespect. "But anyway, it is important to see
more for a success career of a lawyer." I think it is hard for a man over fifty to go up and down
in the society.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening I was astonished when I heard that the girlfriend of Weida determined to
take the postgraduate entrance exam of Tsinghua University this December. "So you can assist in her math and English." I commented. "But to save her English is very hard." Weida sighed.</p>
