# Go to the hospital
2021/2/15

On the Chinese New Year's eve I felt a tumor was growing from my left hip.
For me this is an old problem. Last year when I stayed at home during the covid
special period I was admitted an operation in local hospital.
The next day I went out for a supper with two younger lab mates, who also stayed
in campus during the holiday. The restaurant was chosen by Zhicheng An and
turned out to be flavored with spicy cuisine. To some extend this kind of
cuisine may worsen my health condition. Zhicheng An was a second year master
student, who was anxious about his personal future. He said
he disliked his original research plan, which focused on system and chose the
hot area "Artificial Intelligence" instead. On this domain, he was eager to publish
paper and was jealous of those with top conference paper, such as Zifeng Wang.
Another student was Yiyi, who was a doctor with master degree from University of Southern California, also worried about the future but with a more calm mind. He observes the reality
more carefully than others and often gives unique comments on details others mostly ignore.
"Why there are so many sketch comedies on youth love stories on New Year's Gala?" Yiyi explained,
"Our government becomes anxious about the marriage rate and low birth rate."

On the second day of lunar calendar, I negotiated my health condition with my father
and it was settled that I went to Guangzhou for a better hospital. My father had
been provided a big house near his working location in YueXiu district. He went
to a private company and worked as a law practitioner two months ago. So today I went
to the first People's hospital of Guanzhou with my parents. The
examination is quick and a small operation was conducted for the purpose of drainage.
There were not many patients in the hospital during the spring festival holidays.

As students facing the choice of jobs, we sometimes discuss about the planed city in the
future. Though potential strength of development is big in Shenzhen, the public health
service is not strong now. Yiyan, whose father is a professor at Shandong University,
tends to choose a second-tier city for a job. Such intension is also shared by Xinyi,
who do not like rapid pace. For me, I think a challenging job is acceptable with
flexible time in weekends.
