# Children's Day
2021/6/1

Tomorrow Fei Ma would go to Tencent AI Lab for an internship. Within
this circumstance, we gathered together for a buffet in Gaoneng Mall
near Tanglang Station. According to my regular plan, I would go climbing
from 4.30 pm on Tuesday. But today's weather is not good, and it rained
now and then. Besides, it was not polite to refuse such occasion though my
physical condition is not well recently. So this afternoon, I stayed
in the lab until 5.30 pm when others were going to set out.
To my surprise, Xiangxiang also came. Maybe he was not busy in recent days.
It was also strange that Fei Ma initiated this plan for a reunion.
Actually, I was quite familiar with the other seven PhD students, since
I met them almost every day in the lab. So I wondered the purpose of this
dinner beyond satisfying everyone's appetite.

Taking two taxis, we arrived at the restaurant. Xiangxiang told us
the rule of buffet. "The speed of serving will slow down as time passes.
As a result, the cost is controlled, and it's beneficial for the restaurant."
Xiangxiang said. He referred to a mode when main dishes were served regularly
by waiters while customers have the choices to accept a certain amount or refuse
to take more. I was hurried to eat too much at first, and got full soon.
How pity that I missed the following delicious meat. It turned out that
Xiangxiang became the last person to have extra stomach for remaining dishes.
It was said that he ate too much a few years ago. So he cut off
his eating desire to keep energy for spiritual activities. Today is an unusual
day that he showed us his true eating ability.

After several students satisfied their appetite, we began to chat in some
realistic topic. The new policy on the third child became the first to be hit.
Some chinese idioms like "three after two (one after another, 接二连三)" suddenly have new meanings under this
background. Xiangxiang told his unique understanding of this social problem.
"The era is changing. In current society youth thinks they can live well even
in single state. Apart from regular job, there were various activities to diverge their energy. On the contrary, bringing up a child costs a lot of money.
They need to consider whether it is the piano lesson or dance course when the child is three years old."

I also read articles on this topic from my textbook of Japanese
language. The idea of youth has already been mentioned in the article.
It's hard to tell whether it was current social problem of China or
it is enlarged in our eyes since we reached this age. But it is true
that similar problems have happened in Japan about 15 years ago.
Concerning my current icy relationship with Yang Bai, I gradually realized
the problem is that keeping a romantic relationship became a burden for both
of us, let alone considering child. Yang Bai had said one unbearable
characteristics of me as "calculating everything too clearly that I couldn't
feel any affection." To some extent, I think she also bears some shadows
of this problem. Both of us come from one-child family. We more or less lack from the ability to think more for others.

Xiangxiang was definitely departing for MIT as a post-doctor soon. But he could not
imagine what will happen after he finished his research there. He told us a story to
illustrate the situation. "Last month when I jogged in the morning along the
bank of Dasha River. I saw many burned earthworms on the lawn. After some investigation,
I realized that the reason of their terrible death. In early morning when the sun hasn't
risen up, there are dews on leaves of the grass. The earthworms tend to attach to these
places to absorb the water. However, their speed of movement is too slow when the sun rises up. The dew soon dries up, so is the destiny of the earthworms before they have
any chances to escape the scorch."

I thought this figurative example was reasonable. Individuals have little chance to
escape the influence of the big environment.

Besides these realistic thoughts, Xiangxiang also gave out some reflections based
on his teaching experience. "I found the stories behind the recent research were
scare. But if we returned to the era of Laplace, there were many interesting stories
when they figured out some important concepts. Taking the convergence of series
as an example, when Laplace accepted the criticism of Cauchy,
he hid himself in a cave and examined his book on celestial mechanics carefully
to verify whether the series were convergent."

I plugged in a question, "I think the stories behind the recent research are
not well explored. How about Rényi's work? Maybe some interesting stories
from his diaries."

Xiangxiang replied, "Rényi is a specialist on information theory. He was not famous
out of the circle of information theory. His broadness falls far behind the giants of the antique time. By the way, I read those stories from a book called 'Mathematical Thought From Ancient to Modern Times'."

This book has been placed on the shared desk of our lab. As far as I know, the purchase of this bookshelf was proposed by Xiangxiang to the professor originally in Nanshan iPark.
Xiangxiang asked his roommate to transfer his books to Shenzhen. Finally, these books
came to 1111c of Information Building in Tsinghua SIGS. When Xiangxiang goes away,
he could not bring away these books, and they will become one of the legacies.
Zelong Yang, a third-year graduate student, will say farewell to Shenzhen tomorrow.
Before his leave, he generously shared his remaining books to our lab. It includes
many technical books on the topic of artificial intelligence. Indeed, when one leaves,
he can only bring away limited thing. Books are too heavy to be brought away. So they
passed to students of the following years.

Another unavoidable topic is about girlfriend. Under the interrogation of Xinyi,
Fei Ma admitted that he kept a romantic relationship with one of his university
student, now working in Shanghai. Xiangxiang commented, "Thanks to the technology,
Fei Ma has sought a girlfriend
in the cyber space with the basis of the past physical contact."
As to himself, Xiangxiang thought it was almost impossible to find a girlfriend
since his contact is very limited. "Except someone introduces a lady to me,
I won't have any chance." said he.

The shopping mall of Baoneng is quite large, we spent some time before reaching
the entrance of the subway. Though chatting cheerfully in appearance, I did not
feel well emotionally. By the power of inertia, the life and work still go on
as planned. My internship in Beijing will be fulfilled. Though it will be convenient
to find a job in Beijing in the next semester, it will not be a hard requirement.
