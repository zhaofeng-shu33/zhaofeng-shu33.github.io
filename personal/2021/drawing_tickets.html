	<h1>Drawing tickets</h1>
<p>2021/5/13</p>
<p>A famous singer called "Age of Water and Wood" will give a concert in the conference center of university town this Saturday night. Each class has some tickets but it is far less than the number of students willing
to join. Therefore, we have to determine who will be luckier by drawing lots.
After supper, I went to the book bar to read some pages of "Tradition of Zuo". This habit
has been almost fixed for several weeks. Usually I read one or two years of the records.
The paperback book is placed right on the third shelf over a round table. I believe no one
likes to read it except me since the bar was open last month.</p>
<p>I felt sleepy after a while. After some consideration, I thought it would be better
for a snap, otherwise I could not hold out. In recent days, I tried to prolong
my working time by waking up earlier and going to bed late. I knew there were
huge hindrance to practice such timetable each day. But the point is, I did it
to imitate my hard-working state in earlier youth, especially before university.
The direct cause for such desire to review my pre-university period is a TV series
called "dragon sakura". But I think the deep cause lies in my long-term mind-changing.
Before I went to university, my sight was narrow but I worked quite hard. Then
the hard-working state fades gradually to a strange balance. I only uses about
70% of my energy each day and the other 30% is wasted. Somehow, the energy can
surpass 100% if I were highly motivated and followed the right method. So it is
never upper bounded even the total time per day is fixed.</p>
<p>My girlfriend often asked me why not to put more efforts into the research and tried
to publish papers in top conference. I explained my view to her, "You are solving
an unconstrained problem which tries to maximize your research products. On the
contrary, I am solving a constrained problem. The objective function is
the sum of personal interests while the constraint is that my research products are
larger than some limit." This explanation is figurative. After some practice and
inspiration from that TV shows, I found another important reason why I could only
use no more than 70% energy. That is, I could not find counterpart on the same path.
For Yang Bai, she often compared herself to other students who also did well in research,
and thought "I could reach the cell if I stand on my tiptoe." But for me, I could hardly
check my abilities on other domain with nearby students.</p>
<p>For example, in the past weeks, each morning usually Wanda Li was the one who came the earliest.
After some practice, I found it was not difficult to overpass her if I woke up at around 6:50.
This is just a very small matter but reflects how you observe yourselves. Students like Guodong complained
he feels sleepy if getting up early. If you have an urgent heart to do some important things
and became number 1 to come to the lab. Usually the sleepy mind becomes clear-headed.
Besides finding an imaginary enemy to beat,
it is equally important to find a good model to follow. Usually the good model is domain related,
and it is nearly impossible to follow model A in one domain, while at the same time following model B
in another domain. The behavior of good models is often extreme. The important part is to achieve
the soft ability of that model regardless of his method. I believe I can develop my own method
towards the desired soft ability. By using the word "soft ability" I mean it is not a requirement to get
some certificate but a level of ability.</p>
<p>Return to the reality, I made a alarm-clock at 7pm, in order to draw the lots at that time.
There were only 7 tickets while for my class the number of students who draw the lots is 32.
Luckily I got a red packet with relatively large amount of money. With my timely remind,
Zhiyuan Wu also had a good luck. My roommate, Pengyang Zhao, had to say goodbye to the concert ticket.
He also failed the certificate exam of our department, which means that he could not graduate next June.</p>
<p>Guodong Li, who was the class assistant for doctors of 2016 grade, missed the notice to join the lots.
He was somehow regretful.
Then he would distribute 6 tickets to these high-grade doctors, but he won't use his power to preserve one ticket for himself. I asked him the reason, he said, "It's not good. The tickets are really precious."</p>
