	<h1>Humanity dream</h1>
<p>2021/2/26</p>
<p>Yesterday I had a dream in which Xinyi Tong expressed his opinion on the heir problem of State Jin.</p>
<p>One night, he saw I was reading "the Zuo Tradition". The paragraphs are about
the heir problem of Duke Xian of Jin. He abolished the prince position of
his eldest son, Shensheng to favor another son, whose mother is his
favorite concubine. After glancing over the historical record of this story,
Xinyi predicted that violent disorder would happen after the death of Duke
Xian of Jin. I asked for his grounds and he said:</p>
<p>Li Ji does not obtain wide support and was not good at politics.
To secure his position, buying
the heart of people is of vital importance. Killing the elder son only puts
herself and her son in a dangerous position.</p>
<p>I forgot many details of his grounds, but what he said is not like the destination theory in the records. It is such a mixture of history and current time that
I could not distinguish the time gap between that event and the comments of Xinyi.</p>
<p>As far as I knew, this was the first detailed records when the power was
passed over the elder in favour of the younger. It is a failed case and led to
internal disorder of State Jin. Such choices happened again and again in the later
history of China, and there are also many successful cases. It is difficult to say
which one is better, insisting on the eldest or choosing the younger. But in the
traditional view of Confucianism, they insist on choosing the eldest. In modern view, though plausible in some sense, their explanations are biased and do not consider the development of society.</p>
