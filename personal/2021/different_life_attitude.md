# Different life attitude
2021/5/21

Today is the birthday of Xinyi. Surprisingly,
eight other students ate together to celebrate this special day.
Apart from the "five tigers", our big brother Xinyu Liu was also at present.
Beside him, there were two first-year doctor students, Yi Yan and Jian Xu.
The ninth student is Lu Liu. She joined us by accident, and even I did not
know why. She had long-time internship outside Shenzhen in the past, and came
to Shenzhen recently to finish her master degree dissertation.
Since there were students I were not familiar with, I did not speak too much on
the table. As few restaurants have places for nine people,
We chose the Northeastern Dumpling Restaurant as the spot.
Then Xinyu and Weida went out for a birthday cake, while others chatted leisurely.
When Xinyu came back, the dishes began to be served. Then we moved our chopsticks, and the
topics suddenly ended. To save the scene, our big brother mentioned an opportunity
to introduce one relative of his colleagues to one of the excellent single doctor students
in our lab, including Guodong, Zhiyuan, Xinyi and Jian Xu. I thought both of the four
felt embarrassed. The next topic was K12 education, also put forward by Xinyu.
It was hard to have an interesting topic for all students.

After the union, others went back to the lab, while I accompanied Xinyi
to buy some eating in the nearby supermarket. Now there were only two persons,
so I used this opportunity to retell the possibility of making acquaintance 
with Jieying. Xinyi had no incentive to do so. After finding no interesting point
from my oral description of Jieying, he refused to have the first meeting.
He asked me what the hobbies of her were, but I could not tell. In fact, in the last
meeting with her, I only knew something about her career path. So I emphasized on their
match in the expected career and experiences. But Xinyi did not care much about
these conditions, and thought there were no topics to start the relationship. He pointed
out Jieying never showed her wechat moments, which justified they were not of the same type.
I argued with him not to judge her by a single rule. Then the topic came to whether I was
familiar with the heart of Xinyi. Indeed, I thought
I shared many similarities with him. But to the motivation behind the hobbies
we shared, it may be quite different. I guess the life attitude of Xinyi was between
the idealism and hedonism. Xinyi declared that he tends to be hedonic. "Learning ancient
Chinese makes me happy. This happiness has no difference with the pleasure playing
computer games brought to me." Xinyi explained the underlining plausibility behind
his philosophy. I argued for a different interpretation of "hedonism" by emphasizing
on the differentiation of hobbies. In my view, hobbies or activities are 
put on one level of a huge pyramid. More people undertake it, the higher its position will be.
Xinyi admitted that this standard came from matter of fact, but insisted on
the similar feeling obtained from the activities. He said, "When I was busy, I played games for leisure. When
I was not busy, I could study classical Chinese. That's all their difference."

"Apart from mental pleasure, does the satisfactory feeling consist of other components?" I asked and
explained further, "For example, when you were fans of Beijing opera. You found pleasure
from appreciating the show, but you also felt a sense of mission to impart this
quintessence to the next generation."

"No sense, I didn't have such strange feeling when I was studying classical Chinese." Xinyi replied.
"Maybe it is your mindset. You learn foreign languages because they were at the top of the
imaginary pyramid. The more you are capable of, the more superior you feel towards others."

I partially accepted the analysis of Xinyi, and said to him:
"Not really, the motivation for learning foreign languages is complex. So why do you learn Japanese?"

"That was because I came into contact with Japanese culture in early ages. Then I knew a lot
about ancient history of Japan."

...

When we returned to the lab, the discussion didn't end. The crucial question becomes whether Xinyi
and I were very similar. In Xinyi's view, we are totally different types. But I think we are similar,
especially in the domain of interests. Xinyi retorted that he spent more time in game and TV series
than more "elegant" hobbies, while I put more weight on the hobbies at the higher level of the pyramid.
At this time, Jian Xu, whose seat was just opposite that of Xinyi, made a comment, "games are likely
to spoil your image when you are exposed to strangers. Besides, hobbies like games have less nutrition
than others like reading literary books. The latter is like looking upwards to the sky."

I agreed with the comments of Jian Xu, so I asked Xinyi, "Would you like to show your hobbies
of gaming and those of reading simultaneously?"

"Of course! But you type don't like the former one. Indeed, nowadays seldom likes to play a game called
'Gujian'."

"I think you put too much emphasis on the property of hobbies. When you grow older, this factor
becomes less important when choosing a girlfriend." I said to Xinyi.

"I admitted your point. Maybe that's why you tell me you could still get along with Yang Bai even
though you two share few common hobbies." Xinyi replied.

At this time, Weida agreed with Xinyi, "That's true. The girlfriend of brother Feng is a research
lover."

During the hot discussion, I gradually realized why my plan to introduce Xinyi to Jieying failed
on the side of Xinyi. Xinyi has never established romantic relationship with female students before.
He looks forward to a kind of romance in which he really felt in love to a girl. This should be better caused
by accident instead of the brute force method through the power of go-between.
The difference of the two love views are clear. When people are young, they tend to believe
in the first one. That is, true love exists, and the couple can strengthen their relationship
by common hobby. Years ago, I was definitely this type. The latter view should not be called
"true love". It is a compromise under the pressure of reality. The most important factor then becomes that
both sides have similar educational
experiences and promising career. Other realistic factors matter. But common hobbies are the least important.

When people experienced more, maybe they would find the latter is more common, or the first case faded to the
latter one. Realistic factors become more important. But Xinyi was still young. He has to experience the
sweet and torture of love before he becomes mature in such matter. I respect his current decision and
wish he could start a romantic relationship soon.
