# Trade off between communication and self study
2021/4/11

It is said that the electricity in the Information Building will be cut off at 8pm.
Thus we four, Xinyi Tong, Guodong Li, Zhiyuan Wu and I leaf the building before that time.
We stood outside to wait for the time when the whole building goes off power.
During that time, Xinyi Tong gave us a short introduction to a topic on ancient paleography.
Within this topic, I had intense dialogue with him, until Guodong said the waiting was hopeless.

Back to dormitory, I wondered how the communication with Xinyi helped me in recent months.
Xinyi is special in a sense that we shared interests in Japanese language, ancient Chinese history
and poems. On the other hand, he also had other interests, which were common among youth in our ages.

I had to admit I had progress on these fields through the communication with Xinyi now and then.
Suddenly I remembered Chenxi Wang, one of my middle school classmates. He also loved Chinese history
and poems. I had good memory on the History of Ming through discussions with him almost ten years ago.

Through the piles of emails, I also found the desire for communication in other fields like English
language and literature. But they were not so efficient as instant discussion. Usually it was the
expression of one side. Still, they served as the summary of my activity, and through such kind
of summary, I can organize myself better in some sense.

Looking back at the past two weeks, my internship application was on the way. It was for Noaḥ lab.
I was worried more for the slow process on the side of HR. Besides, I felt more of the abundant resources on the side of Beijing. In Shenzhen, it was quiet and suitable for research. But when
it came to job seeking and interest development, the main campus can provide better opportunity.

Yang Bai dwelled on the indifference of his former study brother on her paper. As a kind of
interest exchange, she thought it was unfair for such indifference. “I made ppt and wrote reports
for him. But he did not care about my recently submitted paper.”

I devoted much time to learning Japanese in recent days, and the N2 exam will take place in July.
Different from western language, Japanese characters do not represent the pronunciation.
I thought reading was not efficient as listening in such case, as I could not identify the 
pronunciation of unknown words.
