# Migratory birds and rationality
2021/5/30

When I went to the university town library this morning, I found a poster showing
a lecture about migratory birds this afternoon. I hesitated for a while whether
I would attend this lecture or not. On one side, the topic on natural history is
useless for career development. But on the other side, this topic had been cherished
in my childhood. As one grows older, rational consideration
occupies more positions.

I spent some time cleaning my dormitory this morning. The dogmas of Yang Bai
echos frequently in my mind. "Focus on your work, and earn a better future."
This is not because she has said to me many times. It seems that I evaluate
this dogma seriously for the first time. Two and half years ago, when Yang Bai
had difficulty to get her paper published. She worked hard out of the worry of
delayed graduation. At that time, I was busy dealing with the organization
of volunteer activities. After that, under the guidance of a senior fellow
student, she had a relatively smooth path in academics. During the same time,
I began to focus on my research while exploring the path of open source.
Now both of us comes to the moment when we need to decide for our future.
Out of spiral effects, she becomes more confident and ambitious, trying to
make greater breakthrough on her research. In the contrary, I become more
diverted, and enjoy myself in the field of foreign language learning. So
will this state of affairs continue? Surprisingly, we seem to make opposite
decisions. She determines to be an exchange student in Berkley while
I will make an internship in Huawei. In comparison, her expected new environment
is less beneficial than mine when it comes to research. Doubtlessly,
she will be improved in a comprehensive way if she stays here for one year.

In the afternoon, wearing the new T-shirt and shorts Yang Bai bought for me,
I went to the dormitory and finished a mock exam on Japanese listening of N4 level.
I still made several mistakes, which showed that my exam skills were weak.
I got tired and saw the clock points to 14:46 on my computer. At the last
time I decided to go to the lecture instead of spending time watching animes.
When I got there, only a few audiences were present. Maybe it is due to
covid regulation, since for outsiders the entrance certificate of the university town was limited, on weekends in order to study in the library, many people applied for it and there remained few for lecture audience. But it may also be caused by the characteristics of this
topic. It is more suitable for kids. In such a situation, parents will accompany the kid
to join such a lecture. But it is very inconvenient for a family to come here.

The lecturer is experienced in botany but starts to photograph birds five years ago.
Today's topic is the migratory birds in Shenzhen Bay. In winter times, many birds migrate
here to spend a warm time. She introduced many species, which could be found
in Shenzhen Bay. I felt sleepy when the amount of knowledge is too large for me to absorb.
When I became a little better, I suddenly found wechat messages from Yang Bai, which surprised me
greatly. She said that after careful consideration, she thought it would be better
if both of us can step backwards. The main reason she gave behind her decision was that
she found that I considered affairs always in a restrictive rational mind. On one hand,
on several occasions I made comments which showed my selfishness. On the other hand,
I did not show affective attitudes when I got along with her.

The lecture did not end at that moment but my mind was in a mess. Is it possible
for us to get through this difficult time? I became less sure. How could I take her heart
back? Indeed, both sides become tired after the marathon of the intimate relationship started
ten months ago. It is not easy for me to behave just as the beginning of the marathon:
energetic and dedicated. Yang Bai mentioned two times the goodness of the boyfriend
of her confidant. He behaved in a generous attitude towards his girlfriend. The three
met in a restaurant when Yang Bai served her internship in Beijing, and they chatted
cheerfully while eating.

After the lecture, I made a phone call to Yang Bai, trying to save our shattered
relationship. I did not know whether I explained myself well but at least Yang Bai
gave me a stair to step down. "I will reconsider this. But during this process, I
hope both sides can think about it calmly." She said.
