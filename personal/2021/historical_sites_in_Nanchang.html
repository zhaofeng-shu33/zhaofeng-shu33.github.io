	<h1>Historical sites in Nanchang</h1>
<p>2021/3/7</p>
<p>This morning we returned to Nanchang and payed a visit to the famous old
building -- Pavilion of Prince Teng. Actually this place was rebuilt in
the 80th of the last century, and its reconstruction symbolizes
that our country enters a period of prosperity. So many famous figures
had visited this pavilion in history. They made new poems, and wrote the
essay "Preface to the Pavilion of Prince Teng" by their hand. Xinyi looked
tired today. He said he suffered from internal heat last night and did not have a good sleep.
The weather was cold, especially when we stood behind the railing of the pavilion, since
the chilling wind was blowing outside.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we drove to the museum of Haihun, a place Xinyi was longing for several days ago.
We came quite so late that we nearly missed the last window to buy the ticket.
The museum exhibits the artifacts excavated from the tomb of Marquis of Haihun.
From cultural point of view the most important discovery is a mirror whose backside contains
the earliest image of Confucius. And the tour to this museum ended our travel in Jiangxi province.</p>
<p>In retrospect, I think this journey as a exploration of natural scenery and a contact with
ancient culture. It is a short relax during the busy routine of graduate student. I met
wonder local people instead of my travel partners. For example, a boatman of our raft
told us stories of mountains in a heavy local tone; a seller of tofu in the antique town
of Shangqing guaranteed that he made the tofu purely by hand and it tastes better than
those made by machines. All these honest words and gestures leave a deep impression on me.
I promised to Sima that in his marriage rite I would come here. Who knows how many years
will pass when that day comes?</p>
