	<h1>Reject again</h1>
<p>2020/7/29</p>
<p>Today when I started off for climbing, I received
a rejection email from "Communications in Mathematical Research".
It seems the paper I submitted did not enter the normal review
process and the rejection reason is due to "not up to CMR standard".
I am confused and disappointed for the result. This is the second time
of this short paper to be rejected. The first time is due to too narrow
research focus for a general letter.
Yang Bai told me to keep a good spirit for the next submission.</p>
