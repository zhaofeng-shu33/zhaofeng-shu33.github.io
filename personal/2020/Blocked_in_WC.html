	<h1>Blocked in WC</h1>
<p>2020/2/17</p>
<p>Today when I went to the toilet in the hostel this morning I found the door could
not be open from inside. Actually I had locked it but it seems that the lock did not
work at this time. I had no choice but to knock the door and cry "Help". Soon the host manager came and she opened the door using some supplementary keys. I was shocked and felt terrible when I was locked inside the toilet.</p>
<p>Actually I was bored with eating KFC, MacDonald and Burger King each day. This noon I tried the local canteen and found it was not a bad choice. The price is a little bit cheaper than the fast food and the taste is not bad.</p>
<p>It seems that the coronavirus situation of China was released greatly except for HuBei Provence. However, the regulations of many places are stricter. It is harmful to both the life and work of people. I think the reaction of our government is not kept in pace with the actual fact.</p>
