# Meet person
2020/9/9

There are two ways to meet person, either virtually contact
or physical nearness.

For some people in my wechat list, it is hard to have further
interaction. In recent three days, we have the charity day,
initialized by Tencent. Some Shenzhener I knew previously
strongly supported an organization called "Encouragement
Social Work Center" (Chinese, 砥砺社工中心). I read the story
of this organization before. But I did not know how to behave.
Indeed, I had jumped out of the Volunteer Circle. The last
straw comes from my quitting of "Beautiful Soup" (Chinese,
美在心灵). After two years of serving as the website maintainer,
I was tired and they appointed another person, who was unable
even to pay for the extra fee of the website. As a result,
the website of this organization is inaccessible now.
I met an IT guy in my virtual moment of wechat, he supported
a NGO targetting the mentally disabled child. I met a NGO secretary
who supported the Encouragement Center. A woman even messaged
me to tell the story of this Center. I did not abandon her for
doing so. But what I can do is very limited.

Besides virtual meeting, I also met some people offline. It
includes a guard of Information Building, who usually greet
me when I pass by. I met a boy who sent out fit keeping ads
at the same location in Pingshan Village. He said the same
sentence to me for consecutive two days: "Handsome boy,
here is something about gymnasium...". I interrupted him
with some negative body sign.
I also met an old woman
who were seeking some useful matters from the garbage truck.
