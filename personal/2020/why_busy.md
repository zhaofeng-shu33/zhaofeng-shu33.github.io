# Why busy
2020/9/14

After a busy weekday, I was suddenly lost in thoughts about
why I was so busy. Indeed, there were near and far deadlines.
For near deadlines, it
includes TA jobs, paper revision and open study preparation.
For far deadlines, it includes new research products, new experiment
results and new paper writing. These are necessity, which means
you should finish sooner or later. But there were also affairs which
have no deadlines, like foreign language learning, traditional Chinese or foreign novel reading, writing
essay without academic purpose. Indeed, I want to write about my unforgettable part, write review articles on how modern science could impact on autism and
write some technical article on software usage.

Maybe the reason I had more like on affairs I less frequently did was just
because I encountered fewer holes in their domain. So is it possible to balance the more frequent and the less frequent? There are pros and cons
for adopting such approach.

When I looked back to my past, from the high school, I kept the "whole person" spirit until my third year in undergraduate education. From that
time, I became more and more focused on some narrow topic. It is mainly
the pushing force of environment, I think. It is nearly impossible to
divide time evenly on many areas. For other self-chosen area, there is
little stimulus and when it became a routine, I would dislike it and
lost the initial strength to stick on. It is a really sad story and I
did not know how long I could still keep on learning foreign language.
