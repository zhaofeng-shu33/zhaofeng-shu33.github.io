# Different life and roles
2020/4/25

Recently I was admitted to the local hospital and today is almost the 7th day. Actually
I do not think it is a bad problem to live in hospital. The relationship between I and parents
are better than I want independence at home. On the other hand, I can still do some study work
in hospital and the efficiency is even higher than when I am at home since the environment is
not lonely for me. Thirdly, I can hear about different stories of patients in the same room.

A small boy, who is in 5th grade of Oriental International Elementary School, lives besides me.
He had operation of appendicitis using the technology of minimally invasive surgery. As far as I
can remember, I also had this kind of operation but in my childhood, there was no such advanced
technology. I heard that this is more expensive than normal surgery but it is commonly used now.

He did not attend the web class of his school during his staying at the patient rooms. Instead,
he was eager to play smartphone games whenever he acquires the smartphone from his mother.
After all, his mother asked for a leave to the web class for him. Still, he had to finish part of
his homework.

His mother is from Yunnan Province. His mother and father met and fall love with each other when his father did works in Yunnan. Afterwards, his mother joined his father and they went back here,
a small town Yicheng.

It is expensive for the family with 3 children to go home of her mother. Nowadays, they take the high-tech train and the round-trip is almost 10,000 Yuan if the price of the children were not half cut. Also, they need to prepare some gifts for the relatives of her mother.

Her mother does not have a good job in Yicheng. In fact, she only received about 2000 Yuan salaries per month, besides some guarantee in Labor and pension. They lent a house near Peach Round Road,
about 400 Yuan a month. But the price is soon to be higher as many other lent houses in YiCheng
becomes higher. At least, new houses sell for more than 6000 Yuan per meter.

Still, the relationship of her family is strong since many relatives of her son came to see him when they did not have classes. Such relationship is just like that of my mother. In fact, all
people who came to see me are relatives of my mother. No friends or relatives of my father came to see me. My characteristics are like my father. One younger student of my lab says that I speak to him just like a mentor speaks to a student. Therefore, I had little intimate friends, just like
my father. However, my father earns three times salaries than my mother. My father is a senior judge in my local town and his salary is more than 10,000 Yuan a month in average. Yesterday when
I went to the second judicial tribunal of the court, one security staff interrupted me. When my father came to take me into the tribunal, the staff had nothing to say. Actually, it is not so right to do personal thing in tribunal. But my father did and he asked his subordinate to prepare a good laptop and adjust the wlan network for me. What I do here is doing my opening reply for my department of school.

There are so many other things to mention. For example, I think my research work shown is not enough compared with that of other students and I had to hurry up. Another thing is that I am determined to teach my father some basic English. Maybe he can pass the English exam, which is required for admitting into on-job graduation education. My father did a hard work in his life.
He passed the national judicial exam, which is very hard for even young students. My father is
willing to become a lawyer in big city when he retired from a position of a judge in a small town.
Indeed, it is very hard just like why I can be admitted to Tsinghua University. My mother is quite
conservative and opposed to some ambition of my father.

The Oriental International School starts from elementary education to high school education but it
is private school. To let his son enter this school, the mother had to handle 1000 Yuan for a semester. Actually his son did not have separate phone to have class or play games. He uses that of one of the relatives. He is naughty, just like me in childhood. I think the private school is horrible since their elementary school also had evening self-study. It is hard to imagine when his son is boarded in the school when their family lived in rural area of YiCheng two years ago.

The healthy condition of my mother is not good in recent years. But she is still critical on house cleaning and many life trivia. As a result, she is easy to get tired by common life, even
though her job is not busy at all. And she is also anxious for me to get a girl friend as quickly
as possible.
