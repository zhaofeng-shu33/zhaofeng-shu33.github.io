# Help and inheritance
2020/10/22

Last Sunday I attended the Chinese student open source conference virtually.
Actually I did not anticipate more from this activity. I became more focused
on myself and intimate people, and focused less on common wealth of surroundings.
But there is still some touch on me. The first thing is that one frontend developer
contacted me, "I can help you to restructure the frontend part of the dictionary project."
I made acquaintance with him at the mainland open source conference in 2018. He was
very active in open source community. His GitHub id is "TechQuery".
Actually he made some starting code and finished the rendering of wordlist this Monday.
After on, I made some comment and there was no progress from that time.
I did not think it was a bad thing when no progress happened. It is really a rare event
when an open source project can be steady developed. Developers always have their own
business and for me, I am also lack of enthusiasm to continue developing my old project.

Another touchable thing is about "xingyu" project. A week ago, a student in charge of
this project from Shenzhen university contacted me about the usage of data miniprogram.
I told him that it may be hard to organize activities this semester, but he told me
their preparation was in progress. Tonight I found the wechat article from Xilin branch of Volunteer Union of Shenzhen University. The 5 universities are all the same. I suddenly
felt the meaning of inheritance. During this process, it is trivial who had initialized
the project, but vital who is currently inheriting the legacy. A similar phenomenon
happened when a 2020 student who is in charge of student science and tech union of SIGS
asked for my experience offline. Maybe she also wanted to organize more activities,
different from her two preceding leaders, who did not have much creative contribution when
they were in charge of the union. This kind of thing is similar to the inheritance in
literature I think. As Shi Tiesheng said, "The universe made an
eternal life with his unquenchable desire. It is neglectable for which
wordly name the desire has."
