Tonight I went to discuss with Fei Ma about a review topic on
the impact of AI on autism domain. This discussion was delayed
to this night. Still, some unpleasant things happened.
Hanling Wang asked Fei Ma to buy an ipad. With the privilege of
student, the discount sums up to more than 1,000 RMB.
I waited for him on the 11th floor of the Information Building,
but he did not come. He asked me to his dormitory and I went there.

Fei Ma expressed his standing point that he could revise the
essay after I finished it. I think it is different from what
he originally posted. I think Fei Ma liked to become the second author,
as he usually did.

I told him some magazines I found at the library. His first
instinct is "Does this belong to Chinese core?" The second instinct
is "Which institution does the author belong?". In research domain,
I have to admit this two questions are important. But I do not think
it applies to this review topic. Fei Ma wanted to make it more academic
while I wanted to make it easy to be understood by more people. That is,
in a popular science way.

The mistake I made was that I asked too much about the personal aspect of
him while Fei Ma was not preparing well to tell others. I think this situation
is typical in some intimate relationship and I had to reconsider it and behave
properly.

Still, there is some difference between I and Fei Ma. Our idea of the
world is different. I had to admit that even half a year ago I was much
like him. I judged my high school students by their scholar degree. However,
after the experience of learning foreign language, joining in some social
activities and
reading some novels (like Fortress Besieged) I felt some difference.

As Yang Bai had said, sometimes we had to consider something more noble than
power, position and money. This talk was given when she had made some success
but I think it more important to insist when you are in trouble.
For example, how to respect person which is inferior to you in some aspect.
How to help people in need. How to make the world a little better.
