	<h1>Professor Yang</h1>
<p>2020/6/29</p>
<p>Yang Li became the associate professor of Lab 2c last September after her two-year post-doctor
career in our lab. As Fei Ma said, it was different to get along with the same person when
her position changed.</p>
<p>As we can see generally, Yang Li was much more hard-working than the boss Shao-Lun Huang.
She came very late to dormitory sometimes. She is also a little bit "push" to her
students and trainees.</p>
<p>Today there is one unpleasant thing happening between Yang Li and me, also between professor
Yang and Fei Ma. Recently, both of us were submitting some paper and we asked Yang as co-author
to review the article. The problem is that we do not give the final submitted version before
we submitted the paper to the target system. Yang Li was a little bit angry about this kind
of thing, out of our expectation. Fei Ma was in his dorm while I was at the lab when this
thing happened. Fei called me through wechat to discuss this problem. We thought
Yang was changing and it was different to get associated with the current person.</p>
