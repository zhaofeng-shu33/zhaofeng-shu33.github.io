	<h1>Meeting interest people</h1>
<p>2020/11/30</p>
<p>I had a little talk with Nan Shen on wechat and found she had interest
in ancient Chinese history. You can always meet interest people
even in nearby environment. Xinyi Tong was definitely the most prominent
among them. Jian Xu was also special due to her interest in Korean and Japanese.</p>
<p>I wondered whether it was possible to hold a meeting for the lover of ancient Chinese
literature or similar things. Nan Shen expressed his willingness but Xinyi Tong thought
it was better to dine out than a boring activity. I hesitated on how to proceed.</p>
