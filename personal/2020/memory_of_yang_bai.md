# Memory of Yang Bai
2020/8/1

## 1) 
I met Yang Bai on 2018/6/9 for the first time. This was the case when I, as the interviewer,
interviewed her for her application of summer social practice.

Then we did not meet until at the spot of volunteer teaching as far as I could remember.
However, she got cold then and had to give up some lessons. She rested in the hotel in most
time and I had not deep impression on her then since I had many chores to deal with as the captain.

After the teaching, we, as a group, had to prepare for the report. Yang Bai was busy with her
research then and absent for some important event. The most embarrassing thing was that I
begged for Yu Wang to played her role as a member. We had a photo after the oral report. One
female in the photo should be her.

In the new semester, I was active for organizing some tech groups and invited her to give a talk.
Unfortunately, she misunderstood the purpose and gave a quite academic report, just as she did in
group meeting. Another embarrassing thing is that Yu Wang came to this salon. At that time, we had
formally broken our relationship and she wanted to reestablish it. I thought it needed some time. Besides, I was busy with activities at that time.

Time flies, I met Yang Bai accidentally in April of spring semester. At that time, I had less
and less social activities and could focus on my research more and more. We had a short talk
on the school bus. After that, Yang Bai though I was elegant in balancing study and life and
showed some admiration. She was at some low mood then and expressed that watching movie together
was possible. After several weeks, I invited her for a movie played in HIT shenzhen. It was in a hall of A building. I bought some fruits in advance and Yang Bai also put on some makeup.
It was a thrilling movie, a type liked by Yang Bai.

Soon her submitted paper to a top conference was accepted and she would go for Seoul.
But before that, her application for Plans of Research Women, initialized by Google,
was accepted. She went for Sydney for a few days. There it was winter. She prepared
a postcard for me and I cherished it a lot.

## 4)
During the pandemic, I was in Saint Petersburg and she was at home. I called her once a week
to tell her my study and ask her condition. I also promised to send some masked to her once
I went back. She was the only one I sent masks to during that time.

## 5) 
The spring semester of this year was almost online, including the serious opening report
of the Electronic Engineering Department. I invited Yang Bai to listen and after my turn,
I did not feel good and called her for some advice. She comforted me and encouraged me to
work harder.

After we went Shenzhen, we met at the Yifang City one night. She was mentored at Tencent 
and rented a room nearby for one month. She told me some ridiculous mistakes she made when
submitting paper. And one paper was rejected directly due to the wrong format. I comforted
her and encouraged her not to worry too much about accidents out of her control.
