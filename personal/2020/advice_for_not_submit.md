# Advice for not submit
2020/9/18

Recently I heard that Yang Bai was not comfortable physically.
However, she was rushing for the deadline of ICLR at the end
of this month. I was worried about this situation and tended
to give some advice for her to abandon her plan on insisting
submitting paper for this conference.

I think I was in dilemma. Very likely my advice was in vain
and even had bad influence on our relationship. But as far
as I can remember, we had promised to act cooperatively. One
was running faster but the other was watching for dangerous
situation for the other. So I think it was not ok to indulge
her if I felt it was really not in good condition.

So if I decided to give some advice, the problem came to how to
organize my opinion. Maybe I could use some example from literary
or historical figure, but any figurative comparison is not exactly
the same with current situation. Indeed, I should give careful analysis
of the current case but I think she knew more details on this topic.
