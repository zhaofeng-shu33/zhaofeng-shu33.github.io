# First research fail
2020/10/14

Today when I restructured my open-study PPT, I took a look at the research contents
of my first research -- info-clustering part. My mentor Shaolun Huang gave me this
topic. Soon he lost interests in it and I continued to work on it. I failed
my first open-study presentation solely based on this topic. This work mostly
follows Chuan Chen but also interlaced with some old works on graph strength.
Because I did this work by myself. When I encountered some difficulty, it was hard
to say what was wrong. Maybe this topic had been explored fully before and other
researchers had abandoned it because they also find it performs poorly on datasets.
Anyway, my first research topic was not successful.

My second and third research topics are quite interlacing. The second topic
was given by professor Ye Min by the mid-person of Shaolun Huang. But professor
Huang soon lost interest in this topic. But I can still collaborate with Ye.
Ye did not push others and went to the office until necessary. So there was little
chance for regular communications. Anyway, I think I still learned a lot on the
second topic.

My third research topic was given by professor Huang on a problem closed related with my second topic. I did not make actual progress on this topic until the
appearance of visiting student Sima Jin. At first, he dominated the progress of
this topic but I soon kept his pace. Then it became equal between us. Since he
was a more senior student than me, I could have more chances to discuss with him
directly. I think I learned the most from this process.
