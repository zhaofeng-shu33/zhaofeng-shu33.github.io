# WOLT second
2020/7/21

Today is the second day for WOLT workshop.
I found the interesting and important
talks were concentrated during the lunch time.
However, I knew little about lossy compression.
Though Professor Yi Ma gave an excellent talk
on their recent advances to explain deep learning
and design state-of-art algorithm for many tasks,
I could not get the idea behind his framework.
Yang Bai seemed to understand much about this talk.
This may be due to her attending of the courses
given by Yi Ma a few years ago. For me, I understood
the talk by Laurent yesterday since I learned the
compressed mapping and fixed point iteration in my
undergraduate courses.

Bai Yang said she was eager to go to Berkeley now and
it was obvious the research level of Tsinghua part
was lagged behind that of Berkeley part. This may
be the cause that no professor of Tsinghua gave a talk
during this workshop. What a strange thing.

Tonight, I suddenly found I could read some German
mathematical articles of wikipedia. Though the content
is not as extensive as the English part, I think it was
beneficial to do research in multilingual way. However,
the level of my other second foreign languages disallows
me to read normally now. So I am still determined to
learn foreign languages every day during my doctor time.
