# Visit of Nanshan Museum
2020/6/27

Today I visited the Nanshan Museum with Yang Bai. The permanent exhibition attracted
much fewer people than the temporary one: Ukiyo-e.

The museum mainly told about the history of Shenzhen. It had some overlap with
the museum of Nantou Old Town. Contrasted with the rigid mind that Shenzhen was
mainly a fish town before the Reform and OpeningUp, Shenzhen was once the center of
a town called "新安”. The heritage was left at a place called Nantou. We can say
Shenzhen as a town had a history of about 1600 years. However, due to the limitation
of specific literature, we only had some history book called "新安县志" dating back to
Qing Dynasty. One important functionality of this small town is to resist the attack
of pirates during the time of Ming and Qing. There were still some remains of artillery,
which showed the spirits of military people of old times.
