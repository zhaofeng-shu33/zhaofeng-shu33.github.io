	<h1>Organize or not</h1>
<p>2020/11/20</p>
<p>Yesterday night I had a wake-dream about the return teaching activity.
It is a perplexation for me to stay awake almost the whole night, dwelling on the sad reality
that the activity was discontinued due to some subjective and objective
causes. I really hesitate on whether to have a try at the end of this year.
I have considered the series of difficulties to make it due to the gap of
the winter holiday of 2020. But it still seemed to have some hope. At least
the organizer Li Liu could still be reached.</p>
<p>I have supposed that my road of volunteer had ended as I became more senior.
Indeed I devoted very limited time as time went on. But sometimes I suddenly
felt a sense of mission and could not resist giving it a try. Then the possibility
of "return teaching" organization is such a case.</p>
<p>Recently, I was considering more on the self perfectness. The idea may come from
my reading of Confucianism and contact with Chinese classical poems. Anyway, sometimes
I find myself detached when considering the desire of secular matters. For example,
I try to eat and drink humbly and insist to it except for some cases when irresistible force diverted my regular path. I think these particular cases could become less if I desire. Just like
Qian Tao, a poet in the dynasty of Jin, said, "Old friends would rather not visit me because I am
poor and live in an inconvenient place".</p>
<p>Another change for me to abandon the reading of wechat moments and some other curiosity-driven
channels. More changes are scheduled but I am afraid it is a long and hard process.
At any port I will return to the starting point, thus making all these habits efforts ineffective.</p>
<p>When some urgent task is on the schedule, I found I tended to divert from the normal path more easily.
For example, when Weida Wang and I were grading the midterm exams intensively in the office of professor Yang two weeks ago. I felt a lot of stress due to the special environment and urgent scheduling. Therefore, I determined to buy two bottles of milk tea through Meituan. It is really a rare case since I never bought milk tea online before. But anyway, when some DDL existed, I felt
very concentrated on the task itself and ignored the self perfectness easily.</p>
<p>The Chinese translation of self perfectness may be called "修身". When I climbed the Mount of
Tanglang this week. I felt something which is missing in my past travel. I thought of how
I can behave to be more stringent not only for the temporary preserve of myself but for
the offspring of humankind. Just like the knowledge or other kind of legacy passes to
the offspring. I think resources follow the same rules. Traditional confucians talked
to be stringent to maintain a kind of pleasure and air. But for the current time, it will
have more deep meaning behind such behaviour. I often read news of Guardian or sometimes
"Die Spiegel". These electrical newspapers with liberal tendency all say about a common theme:
environmental change. The ice becomes less in a more rapid speed in Arctic and other bad news
follows. On the other hand, the accelerating speed of human society confuses more and more resources
from nature. Maybe such worry is too much for each individual. Apart from such background, being stringent has advantages and disadvantages. Someone thinks it made life unhappy since by
so many restrictions one can not really enjoy the multiple pleasure from different aspect.
But in my view, I think life has always proceeds in a balanced way. If I stayed up late
at night, I have to compensate for at least a morning. If I were too devoted for several
days, then it was easier for me to get some illness. If I divert from the balance line too much,
I have to come back with some cost. From yesterday, when I had to make up for some analysis question,
I tried to keep such balance by not keeping work. I ate at almost the same time as usual. Then
having a noon sleep and embrace the afternoon big office time. In the past, under such urgent
tasks, I often worked without eating and sleeping. Then having a good eating and a long sleeping
to make it up. Now I think the latter way does not improve the time efficiency. Maybe it made me
finish the job several hours earlier but it also let me feel the time so flied. I had no time
to think. Working and Leisure cycled. Maybe in the future, I should choose a style to make
working and leisure mixed.</p>
