	<h1>Stomachache</h1>
<p>2020/7/24</p>
<p>Today everything seems to happen normally until
Yang Bai told me that she went to hospital
for an acute stomachache.</p>
<p>She also talked about some life attitudes to me on wechat
and we think we are alike on many aspects.
I look like out-going but I am inward in inner heart.
I was thinking what could I do when Xiangxiang Xu came to the lab.
We were very astonished because it was the first time Xu came here
for almost half a year. Actually he wanted to order
his things, preparing for the move of labs. I told him that
the schedule changed and it was unnecessary to be so hurry.</p>
<p>Xu agreed and we went back together. Before that, I invited him
to accompany me to buy some fruits. Actually I wanted to prepare
a basket of fruits. To my surprise, it is quite expensive for
such a gift. But money is not so important now.</p>
<p>Brother Xu called a taxi and we went back to school. I then went
for the dormitory of Yang to give her the basket. The basket is
quite heavy and there were some sweats from my body. Besides,
the red color inked on my white shirt. These kinds of things are
also not important now.</p>
