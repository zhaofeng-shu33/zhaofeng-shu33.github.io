# Plagiarism
2020/11/11

The yearly celebration of boy's day is coming. At this special
eve I set up to reflect what happened on the problems of PA2 cheating.
There are almost 10 students who are involved in the suspect.
To tell their truth, their submitting codes can be divided into three groups,
within each almost the same. By now, more than half of them have admitted
the wrong doing of cheating. The punishment is a little severer than the first
because this time the students who are plagiarized also have point deduction.
For plagiarists, they got zero points for PA2.

Still, the investigation itself is not going smoothly.
Three students do not admit the allegation of plagiarism at first.
They only said they discussed before submission. However, after my threat
to increase the level of punishment and the opportunity to argue for their innocence
in front of the professor, they finally changed attitude and expressed their deep
regret for such wrong doing. This is one case. But to the surprise of Weida and I,
another student declared that he did not know he was plagiarized before our notification.
His explanation seemed plausible but both I and Professor Yang thought it was quite by
accident. There was still possibility for him to tell a lie. After my careful thoughts,
I tended to focus more on the out-coming of cheating rather than the motivation.

During the tedious investigation, I often reflected on why I were so stuck in the
principle. TA like Weida and Zhiyuan Wu never reported the suspected case to the teacher.
Xinyi Tong also said it was kind to let them go. When they made exactly the same mistakes
in their coursework, it was very obvious there were some cheating. "So why brought yourself
trouble by reporting plagiarism? You know the teacher had no choice but to investigate for
sure. Then you increase your own work." Weida said.

To some extent I agreed with him. Maybe it was the first time that I found convincing
evidence of cheating, I could not make tolerance on such phenomenon. Maybe as I became
more experienced, I would be more open-minded. Then there were only two choices left:
either serving TA role with one eye open, one eye closed, or saying goodbye to this
dirty water.
