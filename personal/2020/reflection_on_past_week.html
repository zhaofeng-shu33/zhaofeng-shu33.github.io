	<h1>Reflection on the past week</h1>
<p>2020/9/30</p>
<p>Since I moved my sitting place away from Fei Ma, we had
few conversations. It may be true that the angry attitude
of Yang Bai influenced me. "You know he is of type informing
too much about the environment and it is your fault to tell
him about me." She said to me, both in face and on wechat.</p>
<p>Another reason may lie at his greed on server resources,
both the hard disk space and GPU usage. He can think of
many reasons to support his privileges and it is impossible
for me to cancel this condition. I have long been unsatisfied
with this situation. Recently there are concentrated tedious
issues around the server and my mood was not good. Maybe it is
the reason I broke out.</p>
<p>So I rejected the pitaya of Fei Ma twice and showed my attitude
not to be partial on the server matter. But the real fact is that
I may not bother the server issue any more and will quit the admin
teams in the near future.</p>
<p>Last Saturday Yang Bai went to Tencent and both of us forgot that
she should also go on work last Sunday. As a result, we haven't met
for about 11 days. It is indeed quite long for lovers living so near.
She was pursuing her paper deadline, and I was busy on my matter.
Once I thought of going to 16th floor and sought her, but she did not
allow in-house talking and it may not be good to have leisure talk outside
the room either. She says it is the custom of her lab, which is in contract
with ours, because we talk freely in-house.</p>
<p>Recently I had more contact with Weida Wang and Xinyi Tong. Both of them
make researches on theoretical topic and have outstanding characteristics.
Xinyi is good at telling stories while Weida is sensitive in picking out
problems of others' paper. I think it is both the training of Xiangxiang
and his own efforts.</p>
<p>Zhiyuan Wu applied TA of professor Yang. The course is "data mining", belonging to Graduate School. I observed that he spent a lot of time
in preparing slides and homework of this course.</p>
<p>It was a good oportunity for me to go out to watch a show in Futian Cultural Gallery. Compared with Nanshan, there are more cultural elements
in Futian. People are busy with research and business in Nanshan, I think.</p>
