# Watching an old movie
2020/8/2

A few days ago I had asked Yang Bai whether she had some interests
in the foreign movie released in mainland China recently. She said
she was busy recently and this day I watched in the lab alone.

Actually I had not so much impulse to watch a movie.
This afternoon I casually opened the electronic resources of the library
of UTSZ (by campus vpn). There are some movies there, not so many. I found one to watch,
which was related with Nanking Massacre. Due to the limitation of
Linux system, I could only watch the video on my phone. After watching,
I searched for some Japanese subtitles since I understood little of this part.
There is no such resources actually. This is not a surprise since the
Japanese soldiers are totally bad in this movie and this movie was not allowed in Japan.
However, I still found some clues in a blog of a Japanese movie fan. Actually his
English and Chinese are not good. It is hard for him to watch this movie since no
Japanese subtitles are available. But he liked the director very much. By the help
of dictionaries he watched very carefully. There are 3 blog articles about this movie
"the flowers of war" in total. He mainly retold the story in Japanese. Since my
Japanese is not good, I had difficulty in understanding his article even with the
help of some furigana software.

Due to some realistic reasons, I could not devote to such thing indefinitely. But I
am still wondering at some multi-lingual feature of a literature product. For this movie,
English dialog takes almost 40% parts. And some core plots are mainly told in English since
the male character in this movie could only speak English. The others are Mandarin and some
local tongue in Nanjing. Japanese still takes some part. I understood a little about the dialog
between the father of one girl and a Japanese officer. This dialog is conducted in Japanese,
some sentences ends with "よろしいでしょうか" etc. So why there is no natural composition in
English, Chinese and Japanese? Another question is about the regional restrictions. This movie
is only official released in mainland China and Hongkong. It is impossible for people in
other countries to watch it in cinemas, though it may be possible to watch it online in netflix.
Still, Netflix is not available in some countries. Another problem is that the spirits of
the movie are not universal. most Japanese people would not like it even if they had the possibility to watch it.

Recently I also browsed casually about some cultural elements in other languages.
You can read news, see posts and research articles if you mastered another foreign language.
But it also comes with great price. I found I put too much time on learning Japanese recently
and my research progress is quite slow. A hard balance, indeed!
