	<h1>Memory and priority</h1>
<p>2020/9/12</p>
<p>I could not believe that I have extended the article about
Wang Han and had some wish for this article to be published
on some literary magazines.</p>
<p>But I have to admit that this is difficult. I have submitted
the short version to both Adolescence and Children's Literarture
(in Chinese, “少年文艺”，“儿童文学”) but received no human apply.
According to my academic article submitting process, I know
it is also important for others in the target domain to revise your article. And revising articles takes a lot of time.
The reality is that doing such things has very low priority in
my current life. I had to prepare for the Morning afternoon report to Professor Huang and prepare for the opening study at the end
of this month. I had to eat with Yang Bai every Saturday evening
and Sunday evening if no particular thing happens. I had to
fulfill my duty as a TA of Professor Yang and collaborated with
Weida Wang. I had to consider the near future plan for lab server
and also plan for the reunion of doctor students.</p>
<p>Human tends to take most attention to things and people nearby.
Therefore, all other things are of very low priority when some
more urgent tasks are pending. It is allowable to be diverted
once or while, but one must know how to survive the reality by
not considering too much about the distant things and people.</p>
