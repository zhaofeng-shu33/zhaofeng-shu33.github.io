# What happens around me and WangHan after high school
2020/4/26

“所以，中学时候你没有追过我喽？” 王涵望着我，“也许是我想太多了。”

“怎么说呢？” 跟她聊到这个话题，我很紧张：“其实若说追你的事情，也许大学里
有一点苗头。还记得我大二暑假给你发了一封邮件表达对你的思念之情吗？”

王涵有点愕然，大学的时候……

高中毕业后，我在北京清华园念书，她在吉林一所普通的师范学校。
从那时起我开始用 word 文档写日记了，英文的比例也越来越多。当时我也尝试着给高中的
同学寄邮政的信：

In fact, my mind is, to some extent, tortured by some trivial matters.
These include untouchable link with icy spirit (her letter to me and my letter to her were both unknown, at least I think this way)...

“好吧，上了大学，我记得刚开始你还给我打电话，你在电话那边说了很多，我在另一边有些不知道怎么回答你。可是，你后来好像就不打了...” 王涵的记忆之匣慢慢翻到了大学那不堪回首一页...

其实关于转系，怎么说呢，阴差阳错的吧。从之前的纠结转不转一直到最后学籍都尘埃落定，晓梅是全程陪同的。后来我转成功后，她竟激动地哭了。我知道她是多么的想学英语，也知道刚开学时她为了能转到英语系费了多大的努力。而我这个一心想学中文的学生竟然转成了英语。和她通电话的时候真的觉得有无限的感慨。

所以我为什么不联系王涵了呢？转专业后，她忙她的，我忙我的。

We do not get in touch with each other for a long time until I am conducting a project called
"DeutschLernen" when I am a third year undergraduate student. At that time I am very enthusiastic about tech and write almost nothing about personal affairs. As far as I can remember,  it was spring semester in 2016. After a meeting about "Future Education"
seminar, I called her about my ideas and she agreed to help me to some extend. That is, to
collect German corpus resources and write down some words. To further negotiating such thing,
we have a meeting in YiCheng, with the presence of Sun XiaoMei. It was in a drink store near a river. XiaoMei hinted me to talk some personal affairs and to take grasp of this chance but I
did not have feeling to do so. After all, this meeting was quite formal and I gave a German dictionary to Wang Han for her to help me in the project.
