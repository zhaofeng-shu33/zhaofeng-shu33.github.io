	<h1>Perfect life</h1>
<p>2020/8/31</p>
<p>This afternoon my roommate left the dormitory first.
My mobile phone film had come and I determined to
change for the new one before I would leave. I was
quite confident at my ability to finish this trivial
task within five minutes. However, my luck is not good
and when I finish putting one film on the screen of my
mobile, I found there is some tiny "white area" beneath
the film. I was not satisfied with this condition.
"I played with the phone now and then within a day.
The screen should look clean enough!" This is my thought.
So I put off the new film and tried to clean the tiny spot.
However, I made a mistake by swiping the inner side of the film
so that the new film became weird. I was regretted for this
outcome and decided to use another film. There are only two new films.
After putting and sealing the sides, I was again unsatisfied with
a tiny place where the film and screen did not stick together due to some
liquid inside. I tried to remove this by repeating putting on and off.
The bad area became larger and larger. At last, I abandoned the second
film and tried to use the first dirty film. Indeed, I accepted the
result that the film of my phone did not look quite clean and bright.</p>
<p>This is only a small thing but I spent a lot of time without a good result.
So what lesson could I learn from it? Is seeking perfect wrong deed? Or
I am too greedy to get a good outcome? I sink into thoughts about myself.</p>
<p>I think it is not only about the film putting but also about my attitude to
life. Sometimes changing the imperfect reality is accompanied with great risk
and time, energy consumption. Now I have a job and a girlfriend. Am I satisfied with them? If there are 100 sides, then it is almost impossible that I am satisfied on each side. The problem is that the job and girl I do not have seem better than I have. But is it not an illusion? Is it harder to
recognize the bad side of a new job and a new girl unless you get along with them for a long time. So it is not a good choice to think for a better situation by changing the unique card I owned now. This is probability the
film changing taught me.</p>
