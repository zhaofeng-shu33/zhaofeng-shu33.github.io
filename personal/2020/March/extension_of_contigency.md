# Extension of contingency
2020/3/28
Pearson is a great mathematician and he proposed a concept
called "Mean Square Contingency" in one of his [treatise](https://archive.org/stream/cu31924003064833#page/n1/mode/2up).
This concept can describe the relationship between two random
variables. Pearson's original formulation
is using discrete random variables. Many years later, one
paper([Gebelein-1941](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/zamm.19410210604)), which is cited by Xiangxiang Xu in his journal article published
recently(2020) said this contingency method can only be used in discrete
form. However, Pearson used this concept and computed the contingency for
2d normal distribution, which means it can be generalized to continuous case easily.

The original article of Gebelein said:

"
Sein Nachteil besteht darin, daß $f2$ sich nur für arithmetische Verteilungen bilden läßt und daß, wie sich
