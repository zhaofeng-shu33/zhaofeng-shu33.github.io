	<h1>Busy for oneself</h1>
<p>2020/11/8</p>
<p>Many things happened this week and I was determined to summarize those which leave relatively deep impression on me.</p>
<p>On Saturday midnight, Yang Bai told me she just returned from the company. I wondered for her late return. Without waiting for her
reply, I went to bed directly. After waking in the morning,
I replied to her message, but she scolded for my neglect of her condition.</p>
<p>I lingered for a proper reply. Indeed I was never the type to be
quarreling with girls. I had to admit that some impatience existed
as time went on. The fatigue of keeping relationship became more
and more apparent. According to our convention, we eat together
once every week. But this week, she had to go to the company even
on weekends. As a result, the convention was skipped for this week.
For the part of Yang Bai, she was not the type to be insensible, and
ready to admit my online apology directly.</p>
<p>A hard week for me since there was little research progress.
Several promising roads are blocked after futile try. Even for
the experiment part there were problems. The theoretical results
are inconsistent with the numerical outputs. This Thursday I made
an appointment with Professor Min Ye. He was also very busy. And
according to his habit, he only came to the campus on Thursday since
he had to teach the course "Probability" in the afternoon.
Originally, he said I may reach him after class. But there were
other students who were asking questions. The meeting time
was postponed to 4.40 pm. "But it was time for group meeting."
I suggested to Ye. "So do you intend to attend the meeting?"
Ye answered with such strange tone.</p>
<p>Indeed, the number of students who attend the meeting is decreasing
week by week. It is more like a formal meeting than any actual help.
The research domain differs and it is hard to understand the contents
of the speaker except for the background part. But this week is
a little bit special, Xiangxiang Xu and Jin Sima, these two senior phd
students would give a talk. But to get a meeting with Ye, I had to
postpone my attendance of the physical group meeting. Actually I had
already asked for a meeting last week but Ye postponed to this week.</p>
<p>So I waited in my work seat. When the time stroke, I went to the office
of Ye. But there were other students there. I directly went away.
After about ten minutes, I went there again. Zhiyuan Chen was there.
After some hesitating, Ye let me to wait again and promised to call me
when his meeting with Zhiyuan was finished. I had opened Tencent Meeting
to join the online channel of group meeting. Jin Sima gave the talk
on his research work of coding theory now. I had more interest in the work of Xiangxiang, whose turn was in the next. Finally it was my turn
to go to the office.</p>
<p>I intended to publish my full version of one manuscript to arxiv.
But when I told Ye I corrected one conclusion error, he thought
it was necessary for him to check the extended conclusion.
"So before the end of this year I think? You are not so hurry?
I will call you at approximate time. But recently I was really busy."</p>
<p>I may never know why others were so busy. But if I think for myself,
I was also quite busy. I had to learn foreign language, write paper,
and make research. These things occupy most of my time and it was hard
for me to do more for the TA role. Weida Wang also said he did not
figure out new problems for the third writing assignment, "Using problem
set of last year is enough." He said.</p>
<p>For the midterm exam, I also took part in the grading process.
Beautiful ladies in our lab did not have good grades. To my
surprise, the highest score came from the girl whose figure
was not so proper according to the lady model. Xinyi Tong told
me her name was Nan Shen. Professor Yang said, "Sometimes it was
hard to judge a student. For Nan Shen, she was the student who
did not do research in the past weeks. But her basis was solid,
as can be seen from the exam result."</p>
<p>Wanda Li, who was an out-going girl in our lab, was not good
at the theoretical exam of "Learning From Data". Another girl, phd
student of Min Ye,
Yifei Zhu, was better than Wanda in the exam but was far from the
most prominent groups. For Jian Xu, phd student of professor Huang,
behaved better than most girls but was not to his expectation.
The night before the exam, he stayed up late for reviewing and even
slept in the lab (His dormitory was outside campus, a little bit farther than others). After the exam, he said he had calculated his
scores, which was exactly his actual score. This quite surprised me.
"Because I almost wrote nothing down for problems I did not how to do,
and if I knew whether my given answer was wrong, it was relatively easy to estimate my score." He said. After the exam, Jian Xu also finished the remaining questions he did not figure out during the exam.
Today he bought some math books and I think he was provoked by the
exam of "Information Theory" and "Learning From Data".</p>
<p>At last, a mention of xinyu mini-program. I finished the final feature for admin to initialize the new semester. It took me a whole day (Monday) for programming.</p>
