Tonight I went to Shenzhen North station to
get the baggage of my father. He was not of the type who could learn new things quickly.  I waited in front of Exit A1 but my father could not find A1. He came out from Exit A2, which was located on the opposite
side of the platform. Before I knew this, I waited behind the rail of the exit walkway. I searched the familiar face among all those passengers. This situation was just like two years ago when I came here
to receive Xingzhi Niu and my father. At that time, my father had some business in Xiamen but he came
here on a 4-hour train. Xingzhi Niu flied from USA to HongKong and took the train from Jiulong to Shenzhen
North Station. There were also other people waiting for their intimate relatives or friends, or their partner.
A big hug or a lively talk cleared out the fatigue of the travel.

It was natural to get some baggage from the traveler. I suddenly found the luggage of my father was very heavy. As he said, he brought many snacks and some clothes for me. We hurried to a small restaurant at
the shopping mall of the station. My father brought out some food which he had prepared for the supper. I
did not think it was fresh and encouraged my father to try the ordered meal instead.

My father had asked me about the weather of Shenzhen before his travel. But the warm climate still surprised him. He felt sweaty with the coat covered. To have an interview needed some formality, I thought. Actually,
my father had an appointment in Futian District. He also told me that he had to go to Guangzhou, not only to
celebrate one of his old comrade's new work, but also to negotiate with the boss of one company. "They did business with local court and it was probable for me to act as their representative for their commercial deal." as my father said. Indeed, there was many possibilities and much indeterminacy. My mother strongly opposed to the decision of my father. "It is natural for her, even for whole people of Yicheng, to think I am
crazy. There are still four and a half years before my retirement. So if I would retire early, my salary
decreased nearly the half." This analysis also came from father. I supported his decision but I also knew
it was very hard for middle-age adult to start new careers.

As for myself, recently I endeavoured to the second programming assignment of TA course.
My ambition was a little bit large and it occupied me much time to debug the code. I did not think
my body health was very well since I had got a run after eating some unhealthy food at the lotus 2 canteen.
The open-study was approaching and I thought it was really important for me to reschedule my plans in the following days.
