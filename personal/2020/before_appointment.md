# Before appointment
2020/10/30

This week, my high school classmate Yu Zhang
chatted to me that he had gone over the minigame
project and determined to go climbing together
this weekend. After graduation from Beijing normal
university as a graduate student, he joined one team of Tencent, which focused on some game development.

After the open study last Sunday, my life entered
a kind of balance again and is quite regular now.
The 100 day celebration between I and Yang Bai was
also approaching. Yang Bai had pleasure both in
project, research and watching online soup operas.
It is hard for us to date far from the campus.
Under my suggestion, she bought two tickets for
a musical show, scheduled on December.

Though I did not organize the xingyu project
any more, I was still in the big QQ group.
Under the joint work of five universities,
there are more and more students who join this group.
