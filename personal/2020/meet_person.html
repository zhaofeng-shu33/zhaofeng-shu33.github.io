	<h1>Meet person</h1>
<p>2020/9/9</p>
<p>There are two ways to meet person, either virtually contact
or physical nearness.</p>
<p>For some people in my wechat list, it is hard to have further
interaction. In recent three days, we have the charity day,
initialized by Tencent. Some Shenzhener I knew previously
strongly supported an organization called "Encouragement
Social Work Center" (Chinese, 砥砺社工中心). I read the story
of this organization before. But I did not know how to behave.
Indeed, I had jumped out of the Volunteer Circle. The last
straw comes from my quitting of "Beautiful Soup" (Chinese,
美在心灵). After two years of serving as the website maintainer,
I was tired and they appointed another person, who was unable
even to pay for the extra fee of the website. As a result,
the website of this organization is inaccessible now.
I met an IT guy in my virtual moment of wechat, he supported
a NGO targetting the mentally disabled child. I met a NGO secretary
who supported the Encouragement Center. A woman even messaged
me to tell the story of this Center. I did not abandon her for
doing so. But what I can do is very limited.</p>
<p>Besides virtual meeting, I also met some people offline. It
includes a guard of Information Building, who usually greet
me when I pass by. I met a boy who sent out fit keeping ads
at the same location in Pingshan Village. He said the same
sentence to me for consecutive two days: "Handsome boy,
here is something about gymnasium...". I interrupted him
with some negative body sign.
I also met an old woman
who were seeking some useful matters from the garbage truck.</p>
