# Celebration of graduation
2020/7/13

The celebration for the graduation of nine students in our lab took place at 15th floor of C2
Building, iPark this noon. Mr Huang arranged this special event but many students
joined this "party" online. With the permission of professor Huang, Fei Ma will buy
some gifts for the graduated students and there is also some chances for the audience
to win some gifts. Unfortunately my luck is not so good and what I got is equivalent
to "Thanks for participation".

As can be seen, the three doctor students are more devoted to the event than the six
master students. As the oldest study sister Rui Ma said, "I think the hardest
part of phd process is overcoming the fear of your heart." Xiangxiang Xu
is more out-going as he may stay at the University Town for more time.

Xinyu Liu rarely appeared at the lab but this time he came and he was the only
graduated student on spot. There is some technical problems when the joint meeting
is going but almost every participant was devoted to the meeting and it was not a
bad ending for the nine students, I think.
