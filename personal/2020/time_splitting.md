# Time splitting
2020/12/13

After several days occupied with increasing domain of interest, I found
it became impossible to parallel them any more. Decisions must be made
to strip some parts while keeping others. At the highest level, I
found myself learning three foreign languages, reading German newspapers,
history of Ming dynasty in English, Chronicles of the Eastern Zhou Kingdoms,
Classic of Poetry, translating a german HGR article, devoting to the preparation
of return-teaching, dealing with the TA duty and worrying about the actual 
research progress.

I found Xinyi Tong was quite diligent recently. He devoted his time to debug the programming
code and learned to write programs in deep learning during this process. He also told
Weida and me that he wanted to become a polymath. According to the understanding
of Xinyi, polymath is a person who know many things shallowly. "The path to become
a polymath is reading zhihu." He said. "But why don't you read books, which have
more systematic knowledge?" I wondered. "The most important thing is through accumulation.
Zhihu is better than reading boring books." He revoked.
