# Call Yicheng library
2020/12/19

This Friday afternoon, I called fixed telephone of Yicheng library.
My purpose is to recommend the speaker Wang Han to give a lecture
on some literature topic. As was expected, the secretary herself
could not make the decisions. She said she would contact
the library master and if there was some progress, I would receive
the callback. Such things often have little probability to succeed,
even Yicheng is my hometown and a small place. There was very few
lectures held by this library due to its closeness and backward pace.

Kind behavior is not always rewarded. Calling library is one thing.
Organizing the return teaching activity is another thing. After
some careful consideration, I made a conclusion that there was little
probability to get a good place to held the return teaching activity
and the best choice left is to abandon the on-going plan. It is
strange to say that the vast Yicheng could not tolerate a tiny
desk.
