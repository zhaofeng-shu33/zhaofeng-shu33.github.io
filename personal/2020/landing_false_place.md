# False Landing Place
2020/3/26
There is a news in Weibo which said one of Air Asia flight landed at another place due to emergency. That is one passenger who sat near to the pilot had some symptoms of coronavirus. The source is from New York Post, which said the flight landed at Maharashtra, which is far away from its destination, Delhi.

I searched some India news and all said it landed at a remote bay. I think it is a place in Delhi, as reported in this [news](https://web.archive.org/web/20200324154306/https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/coronavirus-delhi-airport-has-parking-problem-as-airlines-ground-planes-2199230). In short, since many planes are grounded. The airport in Delhi needs extra place for planes to land there.

I conclude that the news in New York Post gave the misleading information that the plane is landed half a way. And some Chinese media spread this misleading information.
