# Open diary
2020/5/12

Binghe:

Firstly thanks very much for your public sharing of your diaries from 2006 until 2020. As a "backward wave" I really learn a lot from these 14 years.

A short introduction for myself, I am a reader of your blogs while I am also a writer for my own blogs. I find your 163 blog link from a twitter post and followed up to live journal. Interesting, you are not the first one which wrote personal blogs for more than
13 years. A month ago, I found a blog, whose author works at R studio company in USA now.
His blog starts from the last months of his undergraduate time till his current thoughts
in recent months. The blog site changed a lot during these 15 years. But he made some backup and transfer so that you could find all the articles on his new blog site. The source code of this new blog site is accessible on GitHub.

It is amazing to overview your personal blogs since they are not limited to technical
discussions on your major. Things in IT are outdated very soon but feelings are not
easy to capture. What you reflect is very different from how you feel at that time.
I think it is really a treasure for both the author and the readers to appreciate
personal blogs.

Nowadays, not only famous people have the privilege to make diaries. Common intellectuals
can also do it and even make some comments to diaries of others with equal level.
What I say about equal is a relative concept. I am not equal with the great writer FangFang
therefore I cannot talk with her freely. Many programmer monkeys are not equal with you
therefore they cannot talk with you. They appreciate you since they think you are
the outstanding one coming from their community. You are persistent with your own ideas and
path.

So what is the proper way to live a meaningful life? Norms tell us you should get a high scholar degree to find a good job and a good partner. Then you should live in a big city and have a good salary. Each task should be done at a specific time period. Otherwise, others may think you are not conforming to common rules. Taking Ph.D. degree as an example, nowadays many Chinese students are pursuing this degree just after their undergraduate. Only few people are applying it after several years of work. But often,
we say quite fresh Ph.D. have trouble in producing their paper while those "old people"
can deal with their precious research opportunity quite well. One reason may comes from
the fact that since many fresh Ph.D. students are seeking this degree according to norm and
have little inner stimulus to push themselves. I think it is not a good phenomenon and to some extend I belong to this kind of group.

Anyway, life is not only concentrating on some research topic. You mentioned your leisure like for many things, taekwondo, camera and other interesting things. Among them I am astonished is the foreign language. Actually you learned Italian first out of interest.
Later you found it was also an opportunity to study aboard in a country whose mother tongue is not English. It is hard to say how many foreign languages a person can handle with since the regime of mastering is quite sparse. It is ok if you feel satisfied. Still,
I think learning foreign language is quite a boring and time-consuming "hobby". You mentioned the difficulties of self-teaching at the very start. Maybe you will envy
those undergraduate students who can take many foreign language courses during their campus life and they can be taught in a live-session way. But how those people in old times would envy us when they were unable to get internet and unable to look at the amazing multi-language wikipedia.
