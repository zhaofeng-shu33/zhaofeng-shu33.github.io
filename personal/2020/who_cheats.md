# Who cheats
2020/11/13

Tonight I tested the student who was not admitting
plagiarism. I prepared a reserved question in advance, which
had similar difficulty with that of the existing programming assignment.

Unluckily, she did not figure the problem out.
Under the repeating advice of Weida Wang, she gradually admitted some lying
part of her previous statement.

It is really a hard choice to determine whether
I should report the true case to Professor Yang or
whether I should suggest more severe punishment
for this student.
