	<h1>Sister Xiaoyu</h1>
<p>2020/5/16</p>
<p>Today when I compiled old materials of undergraduate numerical analysis courses, the
memory of one person flows to my mind.</p>
<p>She is called Lei Xiaoyu, a normal doctor student of environmental science. I made
acquaintance with her during the first semester of graduate life in Beijing. Indeed
I am quite active at that time. Maybe due to curiosity to have a girl friend. I also
tried other things at that time, such as joining volunteer activities, swimming and tennis.
Trying to make a girl friend may be one of them. The problem is that I cannot get
enough information before I am quite active towards her. Luckily, to some extend the
relationship is not purely of bad intension. At least Xiaoyu Sister taught me a lot and
I hoped I also brought some positive aspects to her life.</p>
<p>I called her sister because she was older than me. The age gap is out of my prediction
from the beginning. She had some other friends of normal doctors, some of whom have already
children. But it is amazing Sister Xiaoyu did not even get married. She is an engineering girl and had trouble to deal with some courses with too much math such that fluid dynamic and numerical analysis. During these short period of time, I hoped I had helped her to some
extend. Such study techniques are used by me at that time but not the last time. I can let
her admire my excellence on such topic but it is only on a quite narrow aspect.</p>
<p>There is indeed some unpleasant moments, for example, so many times I am rejected by Sister Xiaoyu for
some invitation or other things. But there are also some unforgettable moments.</p>
<p>One is an afternoon when she and I went to buy tickets for Chinese opera at university concert hall. With hands on
the bicycles, she walked slowly and I followed. She told me some stories about her family and asked my
future plans. The persons lining for tickets are quite few since it was still time for some classes.
We respect each other as brother and sister though we knew only for a short time.</p>
<p>Another moment is the ending of the fluid mechanics class when it rained but I had not brought my
umbrella. She agreed to share her umbrella with me under my request. We walked on the small road along
the river until I said goodbye to her and went to my dormitory.</p>
<p>There is also a moment when I waited in a newly opened bookstore one night. Also a moment before the numerical analysis class when she told me her hard time through the examination of graduate entrance.
Also several mornings when we ate together in the canteen for some early getting up purpose.</p>
<p>Sister Xiaoyu told me some improper behaviors such as sending chat messages to third person is impolite
or hosting a eating party with little words is improper. Such details are avoided in my latter volunteering social activities.</p>
<p>I exported the dialogs between she and me out of wechat, with some techniques and manual sending. It is
hard to leave something behind, except for these nearly 1000 messages.</p>
