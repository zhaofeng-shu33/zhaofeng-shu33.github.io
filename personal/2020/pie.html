	<h1>Flower Pie</h1>
<p>2020/9/18</p>
<p>A few days ago, a 2020 master student, Wanda Li, distributed the flower pies among all students of
lab2c. She chose a time when there were few students in the lab.
"I do not dare to be face to face with so many people." said She.</p>
<p>Last Sunday, she came to our board game circle and we played Wolf's Killer.
There were 8 students of our lab but she was the only one of 2020.</p>
<p>Today, Weida Wang asked her help for screen recording of the review session
for the Learning From Data class. She also volunteered to do some basic cut and paste on the recorded video.</p>
<p>Compared with her nice behaviour, another student, called Jiashuo Fan, left
a bad influence on us. He promised to the Wolf's Killer but he did not come.
He asked me directly about the role of server administrator which made me unhappy.
Fei Ma and Yang Li also reported some other unpleasant things about him.</p>
<p>What a contrast between different master student!</p>
