	<h1>Exploring the world</h1>
<p>2020/9/3</p>
<p>This afternoon I went to the Tanglang Mountain with
my roommate, Pengyang Zhao. It was the first time that
I went out for consecutive seven days and I think many
have changed in such short days.</p>
<p>I noticed that there were fewer Mobike bicycles in campus
and near the subway station of Taoyuan, which leads to the
entrance of Tanglang Mountain. Another giant, Didi, put many
light blue bicycles and contests with Meituan. The month card
only costs 3 RMB, contracted with more than 15 RMB offered by Meituan.
As a result,
the time of all red Mobike is gone and it is more likely Didi
will beat Mobike in Shenzhen I think. I was a little regret that
I had bought a Mobike month card two weeks ago and it is hard to
find a proper bicycle when I am in need.</p>
<p>After arriving at the foot of the mountain, we found the nearest
stair road was under maintenance. We had to choose another up-going
road, which we were not familiar with. After experience, we thought
it was more flatten than the first road, which meant that we needed
more walks to reach the joining point.</p>
<p>When we were almost near to the top of the mountain, we found some
dragonflies were flying tirelessly. I wondered why there were
so energetic. My roommate thought maybe there were mating.
"It sounds plausible." I nodded.</p>
<p>After the climbing, I suggested to have a dinner in the nearby
shopping mall.
Unfortunately, there were few restaurants in the mall. My roommate
considered for KTC but abandoned his plan after looking through the
menu. Then we went to "Fresh Hema" supermarket.
To the disappointment of my roommate, the supermarket only supported using its App to make payment. Otherwise you should use cash.
My roommate abandoned his plan to buy a baguette.
For me I bought a croissant and a bagel and a pair of pitaya.
After futile search in the mall, my roommate suggested to eat in
Xili Town and I agreed.</p>
<p>I bought some sweet food before eating the Malatang. Then I bought
another icy sweet food mixed with coconut water.
My roommate bought some takoyaki and found it was not delicious.
He spared two balls with me while eating three himself.
After all, we have experienced a lot this night.</p>
