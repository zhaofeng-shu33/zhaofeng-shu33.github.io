	<h1>Missing</h1>
<p>2020/3/26</p>
<p>In English, the word "missing" has two meanings: something you lost and something you cherish.
I think the first meaning is the cause of the second meaning.</p>
<p>In this article, I will try to reflect on the special period in my life, from 2017/6 to 2017/8.</p>
<p>Sadly speaking, during this period I almost wrote nothing down and it is hard to get some detail from my memory. Luckily, too things happened.</p>
<p>The first thing is that I met Han Wang on 2020/3/24 afternoon, at a place called "Deskmate Yours", which is a tea shop. In this small town, people are gradually getting out of the coronavirus crisis. But still the bushiness is hard. During our staying at this place, no other customers came in. Han Wang found the wrong place with the same name using Tencent map. But I gave her the location using Baidu map. Therefore she came late around 20 minutes. Then we talked about own current situation and future orientation. Still, she told me her consideration when she deleted my account from her friend list three years ago. I almost forget this kind of thing and I am quite astonished when she told me at that time she was a little worried about my attitude to her. She hesitated but finally determined to kill it into two parts. And to make sure I do not bother her any more she used some extreme methods: One of her friend told me that "He" is her boyfriend and warns me not to bother her any more during 2017/7.</p>
<p>About one and half a year later, Han Wang is a little bit regretted to take extreme measures towards me. And we again became common friend. At that time, I knew that her boy friend is false on year 2017.</p>
<p>In "Deskmate Yours", she told me some sketch about her current boyfriend. I am astonished to find
that he is her senior school classmates and she had some kind of "two-place" relationship. Anyway, it is their matters.</p>
<p>The third thing which astonished me but was reasonable enough is that her current boyfriend was quite angry when he was told Han Wang was going to meet me. So Han Wang told me it was better not to contact her any more since the circle is so small.</p>
<p>"It is quite obvious for others in middle school to think you like me through a series of behaviors. But I am not sure and you did not give me an answer during the undergraduate time." She said to me.</p>
<p>I suddenly found myself undetermined and seems causal towards such problems in general. Although I
once seek xiaoyuyu intensively in a short period of time, such seeking does not last long. And we found each other not suitable and parted. Except for this anecdote, maybe I am quite so sure about such kind of thing. I told Han Wang that during the undergraduate time I expressed some king of beginning of showing love but it is not intensive enough. Maybe it is because we are not at the same city.</p>
<p>The second thing is that I found my old phone and looked up the message when Han Wang invited me to have a meet in Qingdao. I told her I am going to Qingdao due to Finish-Graduation Trip. She said, "You gave a time. We should have a talk" since she was also in Qingdao. I cannot figure out the exact thinking of me at that time. But as far as I know, I am not so sure about my location and time beforehand. I told her I am arriving on Sunday June 25. She told me she only had time during weekend. I went back to Beijing on Saturday June 25. So during my first visit to QingDao I did not have time to meet Han Wang. I told her it is more proper to have a meeting in July. Sadly, she misunderstood such information and deleted my account immediately. The last message she told me is that she had to go back to Zaozhuang in July. It seems that we do not have the overlap time in QingDao although we were near during this time.</p>
<p>In retrospect, there is nobody to blame since there were many accidents on such things.</p>
