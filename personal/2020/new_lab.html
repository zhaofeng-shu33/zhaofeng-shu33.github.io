	<h1>New lab</h1>
<p>2020/8/21</p>
<p>This Wednesday we had moved the lab from iPark to the Information
Building. Life becomes convenient but it soon became boring
since I studied all day long in the room.</p>
<p>Some misunderstanding thing happened between I and Yang Bai.
It is fortunate for us to quickly clear out it, unlike my
former relationship with Yu Wang. Actually she gave me
some messages one morning, asking for the take-away of
a delivery of her cosmetics. However, I saw the message late.
She sent another message, telling me she had asked one of
her younger study brother to do so. She took for granted that
I did not want to run errands for her. I explained when she
expressed her disappointment. Luckily she trusted in my explanation
and this misunderstanding passed away.</p>
<p>As far as I can remember, there are some quarrels happening between I
and Yu Wang in the past. The quarrels were violent and I often kept
silent. After I thought the most dangerous time was gone, I would
ask for the peaceful relationship. If it did not work, I would wait
until she thought it was proper to go along. The problem is that
the quarrel becomes more fierce since the origin of old problems is
not wiped away. At last, I was tired and gave up this relationship.</p>
<p>When we were packing staffs at iPark. I found one student was helping us.
He said he was guided by Professor Ding. He had finished undergraduate
education but faced one gap-year. I think it was unusual for him to help us. He did not need to pack for himself, but he helped our students out of
kind heart.</p>
<p>Indeed, I had to say goodbye to iPark, where I studied for around two
and a half years. It is difficult to express my feelings of departing
exactly. As far as I can remember, the reunion of szlug is here. Xiaoban
gave a talk on the possibility to do charity with open source.
Xinyi Tong gave a tutorial talk on how to use GitHub. The first attempt
of acquittance with Yang Bai also happened because of the existance of
iPark. At that night, she had to go there for an institute check-in
and I went there for the lab. We met in the bus when we both came back. This is also the place where I met many
good friends for the first time. iPark is my physical start place for xingyu, xinyu and many other volunteer activities.</p>
