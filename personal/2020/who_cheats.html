	<h1>Who cheats</h1>
<p>2020/11/13</p>
<p>Tonight I tested the student who was not admitting
plagiarism. I prepared a reserved question in advance, which
had similar difficulty with that of the existing programming assignment.</p>
<p>Unluckily, she did not figure the problem out.
Under the repeating advice of Weida Wang, she gradually admitted some lying
part of her previous statement.</p>
<p>It is really a hard choice to determine whether
I should report the true case to Professor Yang or
whether I should suggest more severe punishment
for this student.</p>
