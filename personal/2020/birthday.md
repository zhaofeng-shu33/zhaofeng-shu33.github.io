# Birthday
2020/7/11

Everything was happening according to schedule until Yang Bai asked me to recommend
some good boy to her.

I booked a birthday cake and took it out at the cake store. Then I went to
the scheduled restaurant called "coco chicken". Yang Bai had come to occupy
a place. Actually I had come to book for a place three days before but it does not
matter since there were empty places at the time of 6:30 pm.

To my surprise, Yang Bai talked about some noble things like the right way to behave
in profession and social life. I thought it was different.  When we parted, Yang told
me she had reached the graduate goal and I suddenly knew the reason why Yang did not
talk much about paper anymore.

So what Yang Bai and I really talked about? As Yang Bai said, there may be some
treasure in this talking since it was between two senior Tsinghua students.
She said: Nowadays, Internet celebrity ("Web Red" in Chinese) is a popular trend in popular culture and there are many ways to create a new "Web Red". For example, we can record this
kind of talking and make it online. I think there may be some different when we know there
is a recording. Some opinions will be restricted for example.

YB: I had not so good relationship with my roommate. She had stayed in the USA for almost two years
and now I finished the time of one-person-dormitory. The problem is that she takes it
for granted that she could ask me to do some convenience for her.

I scanned the chat history Yang Bai sent me and brought the first example to the eating table.

me: You meant, for example, she asked you to put on some of her bedding clothing before she actually
returned to university?

YB: Indeed, it was an unpleasant thing but I did. I think we are different types and keeping "face friendship" is enough. She sometimes told lies that she did not have boyfriend but actually she had.

me: So you did not like people who did not tell the truth. Maybe that is the reason why you did not
like Fei Ma as well. Fei Ma is a little bit inconsistent in some trivial matters but I think he did
nothing wrong in big matters.

YB: Maybe. Actually I met a lot of people in the company. And I did not like some styles of them.
There is one trainee who is seducing some ideas from nearby engineers. Even the boss had given some
help to her I think. I think her identification is inferior to her behavior. Winning popularity mainly
by establishing relationship.

me: Probably.

I thought of the trainee Ruhui Shen, in my lab. What Yang Bai described had some similarity with her.

YB: Another unpleasant thing is some gender bias I think. You know in AI lab, there are very few female
engineers.

Bai also talked about other unpleasant things she saw and heard.
For example, she disliked those male engineers talking about women
as goods. Recently there is really bad news on one engineer of Alibaba,
who did unpleasant things to "recruit" some lady unofficially using his high salary. 

YB: They think it is easy to attract females as long as they are rich. I am
very disgusted about such attitude.

Indeed, we behave differently in different situations. When the biggest pressure
is removed, you can think more about spiritual pursuit but for other students,
it still needs a hard balance between life and interests.

I recommended Xinyi Tong to Yang. This student insists more on ideal than me in my view.
I do not know what Yang Bai is thinking about and I felt a little depressed when Yang told
me she would have a try.
