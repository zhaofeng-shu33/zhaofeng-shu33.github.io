	<h1>Personal Pursuit</h1>
<p>2020/6/14</p>
<p>As far as I know there are three important things which should be dealt with in my near future:
a successful graduation, an equivalent girl friend and a good job. As can be seen, there is
some definite articles before each purpose. To achieve these goals, what I should do is quite
secular: Trying to publish more paper, keeping steady relationship and keep vigil about some good opportunity. There is also some neutral purification process which I undergone recently:
improving yourself by learning what interests you, such as foreign language etc. Another aspect is
rooted as sharing what you know with others, doing what you can to help others. The former
can be formulated in many ways such as Creative Commons License etc. The latter can be understood in the eye of traditional volunteering work. It is also evolving.</p>
<p>It seems there are some intersection between the three roads. For example, if you are very good at
German language, you have the advantages over others to read some old or new literatures, which may bring new ideas to your research. (2-&gt;1) If you make your research results as open as possible, you may help others (1-&gt;3). If you know much, you can also teach others more (2-&gt;3).
If you help others, others may help you to achieve secular purposes (3-&gt;1). If your secular life
is steady, you can spend your free time to learn something else (1-&gt;2). You can also use some CC materials to study (3-&gt;2).</p>
<p>However, there are still many differences between the three roads. The problem may lie in the fact that you have limited time, energy and money to do well in all three aspects. If you focus too much on the
secular aspect, you will spend most of your free time to grab for more.(1-/&gt;2,1-/&gt;3) If you study for yourself
too much, you may be very cruel to "idiots"(2-/&gt;3). I omit other contradictions here.</p>
<p>So how to balance the three roads? Should I abandon temporarily the second and third roads?
I know it is like a pyramid. Most people insist on the first road only. They become cruel to others, and help people based on own interests. Some people are also considering the second road, in which they use some leisure time to develop. Only few people do something on the third road, it is hard not only because the task
is difficult but also there are little comrades along the way. Many tasks are waiting in the queue and people on the third road are split too much to deal with each task.</p>
