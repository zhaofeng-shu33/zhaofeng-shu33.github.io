	<h1>Talk with Fei</h1>
<p>2020/7/22</p>
<p>Today is the third day of WOLT workshop and all doctor students
at Shenzhen came to the spot this morning, including Xiangxiang Xu,
Zhiyuan Wu, Xinyi Tong, Fei Ma and me.</p>
<p>At noon, we came to "益田假日里" for a lunch, eating at "肉蟹堡" at the
4th floor. We talked freely about many interesting topics including
adult products, the election system in mainland China etc.</p>
<p>After that, we tried to enter the University Town with some difficulties.
The problem is that the door keeper at HIT insisted that we should have
the proof of leave. Fei Ma explained that he had applied but the granted
email had not reached him. For me I was not care about such thing and
rode on bike straightly, ignoring the crying of the keeper.
This was the second time I brushed into the campus from this entrance. The
first time happened last Wednesday night when I was unwilling to show my
student card to the keeper.</p>
<p>After that, Zhiyuan Wu told me that he had successfully entered into the
campus from the Northern entrance of Tsinghua. This was really amazing.
Some students like XiangXiang Xu are unwilling to strictly follow the rules
of school. Fei Ma said this may due to that they were afraid that breaking
the rules would influence their graduation. However, it became a common phenomenon
that many students were going out and into the school without normal procedures.</p>
<p>After returning from climbing the mountain, I went to the dormitory of
Fei Ma for some general suggestions to get along with Yang Bai.
Fei Ma was revising his journal articles, preparing for another submission.
I told him the general situation I was faced with and the attitude I guessed.</p>
<p>me: The problem is that Yang Bai told me that she was really busy. She loved
research very much. And I told him I was not busy. Actually I could be busy.</p>
<p>Fei Ma: There is some logic in it. If both of you are busy with research, so...</p>
<p>me: then treating research as loved one is enough.</p>
<p>Fei Ma: I think it is a little bit unfair for boys to behave inferior to girls but
it is hard not to so for winning the heart of your lover.</p>
<p>me: So I think I am making an effort of 7 and that of Yang Bai is 3.</p>
<p>Fei Ma: This could not last for long I think. I call this phenomenon "licking the dog".</p>
<p>me: I think on some aspects you are right. The balance of effects is not equal now.</p>
<p>Fei Ma: For long term, you 6 and the other 4 are better.</p>
<p>Another thing Fei Ma was unhappy about is that I wrote something unpleasant on my personal blog.
He thought me as an "exposure crazy" (暴露狂 in Chinese).</p>
<p>Fei Ma: This is not proper to put your attitude,
put what you know in the blog and the blog is public. If someone around you saw your blog,
what will they think of?</p>
<p>me: What you said is true in some aspects. I have tried not to put too much negative aspects of someone
in my diary.</p>
<p>Fei Ma: But the problem is that you write me as a "dog" in one literary Chinese article about GPU usage.</p>
<p>me: I almost forgot it. I would revise it to praise for your diligence.</p>
<p>Fei Ma: And I warned you that if Yang Bai saw what you wrote, she would definitely
part with you. You know she is even sensitive than me.</p>
<p>me: I will also reconsider the articles mainly focused on our relationship. Thanks for your reminder.</p>
<p>After what Fei Ma had said, I also reflected on this problem. I said to Fei Ma it was related to my historical view of personal life. Everything you wrote electronically and put online could not be wiped out theoretically. For example, there is some technology (web archive) which could retrieve the pages at specific time. Fei Ma suggested me to put some articles as private and I could not accept this advance totally. Fei Ma was unable to understand this thoughts and I respected him.
As he said, we kept relationship with each other by sharing the same thoughts while keeping the differing
thoughts.</p>
