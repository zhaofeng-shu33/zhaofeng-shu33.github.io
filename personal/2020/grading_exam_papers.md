# Grading exam papers
2020/11/07

The midterm exam of Learning from data
was held yesterday morning. After the
exam, Weida Wang and I split the questions to speed up the grading process.

The questions were made up by Weida.
Even for me I had difficulty to come
up with the solution in a leisure mind
set, let alone writing down solutions
while taking exams. After some careful
calculation and arrangement, I set up
to review the first and second questions of about 60 students.
Actually, Weida Wang put the most difficult questions in the front and
most students were unable to answer
them well, especially for sub-questions of later parts.

Weida was in charge of the remaining
three questions but his speed was much
faster than mine. This was probably
due to the review of proof sub-questions. For the proof, some
students wrote down many contents but
they were not to the key. Figuring out
the true value of their proof takes
considerable time. Luckily, many students leave blanks for the proof question and I soon caught up with Weida.

After our joint grading, we input the
scores to computer and get an averaged
score of about 56 / 110. According to
the memory of Weida, it is relatively
higher than that of last year. However, there was no student who got
score strictly higher than 90.

Under my role of teaching assistant, I
often wondered the mysterious aspect of hiding something. The solution to
assignment and exam questions. Actually there is too much consideration for the profit of teaching roles. What if students of next year copy the solutions directly?
What if students focus on their scores
and point up the unreasonable grading?
But in my respect, I advocate the concept of open
classroom, which does not hide problems and solutions. By sharing
with the world, the teaching role can have much greater progress in this process.
