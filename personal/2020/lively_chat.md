Tonight when I came to the classroom I met Xinyi Tong and Jin Sima.
Then we talked together freely, first about the Chinese history,
including local history of Changzhou, where Xinyi Tong was born.
After that, we looked forward to the future of China or other related country.
We all agreed that there will be a fierce competition between China and USA
and it's undetermined who will win at last. Besides, Xinyi Tong told us
Chinese government is not good at foreign affairs and many developed countries
are allied with US. After a while, Jian Xu came to his seat after the rehearse of
12.9 singing competition. He wore a quite formal uniform with a red butterfly knot
in the position of his chest. Then Jian Xu joined us but he talked very little.
After analyzing the political tendency of China, Xinyi also gave his own opinion
on the path for China to defeat USA. "Firstly we should become the largest economy
in the world. Maybe the accumulation of quantity will lead to the change of quality.
Secondly, we should find some newly developed domain and make it the new growth point
of our economy."

"But I don't think the IT domain will bring fundamental change to the economy." I uttered.

"Yeah, Internet area is more targeted at service industry." Sima added.

So what will become the next growth point of China? We do not have a unified conclusion.
We all agree that Chinese government is focusing on the stimulation of domestic consumption.

"But the domestic cycle can not really bring the accumulation of wealth, especially for
the service industry." I said.

Sima: "We need to exploit other country to become No.1 in the world. You can see the US
use the finance lever to grab money from other countries."

Soon we return to the original topic: why China had little chance to defeat US in near future? As ph.d. students with engineering background, we almost all agree that
the lagging behind in high-tech is an important factor. This may include material, mechanics, chemistry, physics, etc.. In my opinion, these domains are still important
though they are traditional. I once read an article by huxiu which analyzed the problem
of the torture of lacking chips in Huawei. This article also mentioned these
factors and thought further to the educational problems. That explaines partially why
overseas talents are more welcome by mainland research center. "Possibily they have the experience to find the secrets of technology innovation." Sima said.

Besides this influential talk, during the past few days I devoted
my time mainly to two tasks. One is learning the topic of Reinforcement Learning and
making up new problems (PA4) for this topic, under the role of TA. Another is reading
the history of England. I suddenly found some interest in the regional history of other
country and thought it was better to do some comparisons if I knew more about others.
