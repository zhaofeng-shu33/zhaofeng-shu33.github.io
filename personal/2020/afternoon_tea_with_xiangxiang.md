# Afternoon tea with Xiangxiang
2020/8/9

Yesterday I had an afternoon tea with my study brother Xiangxiang Xu.
He helped on on one of my manuscript for ITW 2020. The principle
of him is to point out some general types of mistakes in the first paragraphs and let me
follow them to revise the other paragraphs.

"You don't know what you really want when you enter the college." He said after drinking
some black coffee from his cup, "After two years in college, I find some interests in
information theory. But there is no professor in Tsinghua which does some research on
this topic. Professor Lin Zhang is related, but you know, he actually did some engineering.
However, he knew some famous people who did research on information theory.
So it was not a bad choice then to follow Professor Lin Zhang. You did what he told you.
That's the whole story."

I said, "When I was the fourth-year undergraduate student, I met you in the lab, which
was quite a big room. Do you still remember it? At that time, I thought you were a bad
brother, who taught me how to play with the lab equipment --- Xbox."

He replied, "That's the old story. You know, I was quite free in my first three years.
I had already two conference papers on the topic of air pollution system engineering.
Then I could submit a journal to something like (IEEE) Access. After one month, the result
is released. Either I was accepted or rejected. I could submit to another journal if rejected.
Then sooner or later I could reach the graduation level. So what? You did not realize your value."

As he said, I recalled that "So what" is one English collocation, frequently used by
Professor Huang. In Chinese, it could be equivalent with "那有怎么样呢？".

He continued, "So my life path is changed when I came to Shenzhen at the end of my third year.
The next semester, Professor Zheng visited TBSI and gave a course for the whole semester.
I am lucky to be the TA and begin my effective meeting with Professor Huang. You know, at that
time, Professor Huang is not so busy, the number of students are far less than now. So Professor Huang has much more time on each student, especially on me. I think that was the period when
I had the quickest and largest progress. But now is different, Professor Huang becomes
the boss of the whole lab. He has many macro-level management things to make decisions on. WOLT, WODS, we have 2 workshops every year. Professor Huang has many negotiations to made with his overseas and domestic fellows. Finally, he had to split his remaining time into smaller pieces and spare one piece for one phd student. One compensation for such situation is that students should
discuss with each other frequently, I think."

I nodded my head.

After some pause, he told the reason why he thought it was necessary to point out
some mistakes made by me. "You know, your remaining phd time is less and less if you plan
to get a certificate in five years. However, everyone has 24 hours every day. The difference
lies at their efficiency and time management. In the past, I am also quiet casual about my lifestyle. I woke up naturally and slept when I felt tired. But such kind of thins can be regulated
by you. You know, the biology clock can be changed. I do not eat lunch now. Therefore, I do not need
noon nap. Eating too much is the cause of sleepy mood. On the other hand, since Professor Huang is
busy, he may not have time to tell you some details about academic standards, so I think it's my duty to point such kind of things out for you."

We talked about for almost 2 hours. At 4pm, we left the coffee bar. Xiangxiang headed for the campus
while I returned to iPark. I think Xiangxiang Xu will become more excellent in the future.
