	<h1>Common day</h1>
<p>2020/9/11</p>
<p>Yesterday we celebrated the Teacher's Day at one classroom.
Today it seems everything returns to normal. We discussed
the anecdotes of professors, making jokes on familiar students
and so on. It seems a quite common day.</p>
<p>Maybe there is still something valuable to be written down.
I think it was about the expectation of life. Many students
around me think it as a good idea to lie evenly while
earning money. But in reality they often work hard.
I think it is equally important to have other expectations
except for material aspect. I told Yang Bai that in my opinion,
something was equally joyful except for paper acceptation notification.
For example, your technical work was praised or you met old friend.</p>
<p>By accident I suddenly recalled Teacher Huang in HIT Shenzhen. I asked
an undergraduate student which courses she would give in this semester.
A course called "Poetic Life" (in Chinese, "诗意人生") will be given.
I think the course name is wonderful. Actually our life was rushed against
materialized life, but at the same time, how can we keep some expectations
about the poetic aspect? It is a hard problem to be explored.</p>
<p>One way I think is to read some literature works. You can experience
what you have no chance to meet in reality. Other way may include
appreciating other types of artistic works. Finally, it is always a
challenge to create poetic works based on personal virtual experience and
physical experience. I think I have some chance to return to the first choice
if I could spare some time each week to read.</p>
