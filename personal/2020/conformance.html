	<h1>Conformance</h1>
<p>2020/9/26</p>
<p>On Tuesday evening, when my roommate and I came back from
Tanglang Mountain, I bet with him that I did not need
wearing a mask to enter the campus. The method
was easy, I followed him on one side when he used
face recognition to open the access control system.
But to my surprise, the keeper suddenly became angry
after I ignored his warning of "Don't follow." He shouted
out: "Go back!" but I have already fled away along the road
inside the campus. My roommate lagged behind and it seemed that
he was interrogated by the keeper.</p>
<p>Actually, I was frightened by that shout and wondered why it was
still so "strict" on such matters. My roommate told me later that
I should return to the keeper for some apologies otherwise there
may be unimaginable consequences. I did not return back at last.
But I take caution the next time passing that door.</p>
<p>On Thursday evening, I went to Futian Cultural Gallery for a
reading shown given by local artists. Since I was quite unfamiliar
with the surroundings, I behave like a gentleman. The seat of this show should be appointed in advance but I missed the official wechat account
of this gallery. But there was still possibilities to be allowed entrance.
Actually the seat splitting rule was not followed and the
number of audience surpasses half of the total seats. I can feel
some different experience by appreciating this reading show but
once I returned to campus, I had to consider old occupations.</p>
<p>The server training session hold out this Saturday. To prepare for this
event, I organized several senior students and appointed some topics to them. It was not good to push others to do things they do not like.
But professors sometimes do so. I think there should be some sharing
among administrators of lab server.</p>
