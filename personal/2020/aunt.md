# Aunt
2020/7/19

Tonight when I went to Lotus 4, I met again the aunt who stopped me the day
before yesterday.

From her appearance I was a little bit disgusted.
Her face is full of wrinkles and was short in height.
When she eyed me she asked immediately: "So what is
your purpose of coming this time?"

I explained to her that there was a tiny problem with
my credit card and I wanted to prolong its expiry time.

She changed her face from seriousness to kindness and
would like to help me to deal with this problem.
Actually this was her duty. Unlike the previous
time when I did such "update" on my card, this time
I was asked by her with many questions. That is, I was
no longer waiting besides and playing with my smartphone
when my business was conducted by some other aunt in
the past.

She looked carefully at my card and gave some exclamation:
"Why your card begins with triple '1' while the prefix of
others is only double '1'?" This is an old convention
and I did not think necessary to explain to her.

Actually she asked in long sentence while I answered
in short word. I was a little bit despised of her.
Indeed, I think she was no more than high school
qualifications. I could not resist looking down to
people with much lower qualification than me, even
including undergraduate certificate. In Beijing Tsinghua,
the Dormitory "master" should at least have
master degree.

I found her efficiency was not quick. Maybe she was not
good at the computer. This made me more despised of her.
But after a while, I found the problem.

Actually, I was not familiar with the principle
of the card. But I behaved like I knew everything.

Aunt: So how should it happen since your due time is December this year?

Me: I did not know either. I think you can
just refresh my date and I will give another try tonight.

But this aunt was really serious. She was not satisfied with
the superficial explanation. She wanted to make out the true
cause. So at first she was suspicious of the strange triple 1.
After some searching, she found the id series number (starting with double 1)
within the Access Control system mismatched with that on my card.

I was impatient and wanted to help her to quickly finish the duty.
After glancing at the screen I found the valid date of the card started with
7/17.

Me: This was exactly the date when I found my card invalid.

She asked some other questions along my clue. And we together
make the cause out. Actually it was due to the fact that I made
a new student card when my old card was lost. However, I found
my old card back after the new card was made. And the system
automatically updated my information the day before yesterday, thus
making my old card invalid to open the outside door.

So the cause was found and the solution was also easy.
She added my new card series number to the system.
It was true her skill was not fluent as our young adult. But I suddenly
found her attitude was dedicating.

After the duty was done, I said I would like to visit someone in Lotus 4.
She said she remembered I had come at the night of the day before yesterday.
So this time I had to tell the truth that I would like to visit
a student called Fei Ma.

Aunt: Fei Ma. oh, I knew him very well.

I was astonished at her confidence and said subsequently, "So to satisfy your
need, I could make a note on the "In-And-Out book" (In Chinese, 来访人员登记表)
here.

Aunt: No, you needn't, I only want to make sure that no dangerous thing was happening.
You know, I am standing on the side of the student.

Me: Why do you say so? Is there any special regulations recently?

Aunt: Indeed. According to the regulation during the pandemic. It is disallowed for
students to visit each other. But for me, I think it is essential for your normal
activities sometimes, academic or recreational etc.

I was silent when she was talking. I think it is not easy for such position. It is
even harder to be responsible. I am never the only person who rushed into the building
without normal procedure and this indeed brought pressure to them.

Aunt: You know. If the person in charge found I behaved wrong, it would influence on my
credits. So I have to be careful. But for the purpose of students, I think it is ok
to let you in. I am a mother of a student nearby.

I suddenly recalled the exact person Fei Ma had told me. Fei Ma had some negative views on her.
But after some contact with the aunt in front, I thought she was special and a big woman.
Not only in front of her child, but in front of the doctors like me.

I remembered the text I learned in junior school. The title was called "老王" in Chinese,
written by Yang Jiang. They were indeed inferior in social classes but they had kind heart and
responsible for their duty.
