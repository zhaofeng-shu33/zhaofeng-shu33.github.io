# Open study
2020/10/15

Today I practiced the open study presentation before the group meeting.
Amazingly, after my practice I received the notification email of the open study.
The time for my group is scheduled 10 days later.

Recently I became more focused on two kinds of things: learning foreign language and research.
My enthusiasm on IT technology was at a very low level. I felt a little bit stressed as the
time of open study was approaching.
The mental state of Yang Bai was no better
than me. Maybe it was because she made little progress on her research topic. She was quite
ambitious.

A graduate student from Science and Tech University of Dalian committed suicide yesterday and
a wave of discussion emerged online. The direct cause was his posthumous letter, released on
webo. Every student can find more or less clues from his experiences. I think that's why his
death brought so much shock on our group.

The situation became different gradually at my fourth year phd semester. I abandoned the
maintenance role of the server, the website and ideas of organizing new activities.
I became more focused on my personal and academic life. It was hard to imagine previously
I was concerned about the common wealth but now I changed.
