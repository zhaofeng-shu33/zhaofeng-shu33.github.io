	<h1>Entering school</h1>
<p>2020/7/6</p>
<p>Now is already July and it is quite hot. However,
the campus is still closed and students need
application before they can go outside of school.</p>
<p>My roommate PengYang Zhao made a fake certificate
to cheat the gate keeper and went for a dinner with
his friend yesterday. Unfortunately, the rule has
changed and the old certificate, dialog with Teacher
Liang, did not work any more. Finally he came into
the campus under some excuses but he was afraid of
such behavior.</p>
<p>The problem is that our old class has been dismissed
and both of us could not receive some important
news recently. It is a little bit annoying that
we did not know how to behave in the right way unless
we ask students of other classes.</p>
