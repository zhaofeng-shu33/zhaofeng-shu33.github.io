	<h1>Eating with senior PHD</h1>
<p>2020/7/30</p>
<p>Tonight I went to eat with three senior phd students.
All of them will get graduated by this August.
To our surprise, Sister Rui also came to Shenzhen for some
remained baggage. Therefore we had 7 people in total.
The place was chosen to be a hotpot of beaf in Cloud City of Wanke,
near the station of Liuxiandong. During the eating,
we talked about many interesting topics including some
accidental acquittance with unfamiliar people.</p>
<p>After the dinner,
I went back to the campus. Yang Bai had walked around the
playground for about half an hour. We talked about research
progress and anecdotes of recent experiences. The moon and stars
are bright this noon.</p>
