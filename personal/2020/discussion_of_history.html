	<h1>Discussion of History</h1>
<p>2020/12/12</p>
<p>This evening I made an appointment with Nan Shen and Xinyi Tong.
We ate together in a restaurant on the opposite side of HITSZ.
This dinner was special since we mainly discussed on the late history
of Ming dynasty. Xinyi reported that he read parts of "Veritable
Records of the Ming Shenzong" (明神宗实录), and tended to analyze the
problem with respect to the regional difference and economic factors.
Nan Shen talked the least. What she mentioned was mostly related to
some basic historical facts, which were hardly known by I and Xinyi.
The part I disliked about Xinyi was his reference to the discussion in
Zhihu platform. Though I admitted that there were some genious who
answered questions in history domain, many answers were hearsays which
were not grounded.</p>
<p>So what is the most important part while reading history? Of course, it
is related with the historical view. From the discussion I can infer that
Xinyi tended to keep the historical materialism while I tended to absorb
the historical view of world history and the traditional Confucianism view.
I am not sure which kind of view Nan Shen held. She told us that she took some
history courses at the fourth undergraduate year. After the security of her
future into Shenzhen Tsinghua, she tried to pursue her hobbies and enlarged
her mind by reading some treatise, mostly books.</p>
<p>"Reading academic books on history is not an easy task." I wondered.</p>
<p>"But you only need to find the part which interests you most." Nan Shen answered.</p>
<p>After the dinner, I accompanied Xinyi to buy some bread in a nearby store while
Nan Shen returned to her dormitory. This is probably the first time only Xinyi
and I went together on the road. I gradually found the mysterious ring of light around
Xinyi disappeared when I knew more about him. Xinyi is never the totally unrestrained
type who only works in weekday office hours. A few months ago, he said he only
worked no more than three hours per day. But recently he worked quite late. Actually
he changed. His knowledge and mindset about the late medieval history of China
are not fresh. Mainly he promised to go this time because he thought it was not proper
to reject my invitation. It is really rare and precious that you can meet someone who
cherishes the same interest at present times.</p>
