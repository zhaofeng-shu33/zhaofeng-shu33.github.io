	<h1>Eight Phds</h1>
<p>2020/8/14</p>
<p>This evening, eight Phd students of lab2c gathered and had
a party at the 11th floor of Information Technology Building.
Xinyi Tong and Zhiyuan Wu bought some food for us.
After removing the plate located in the center of the desk,
we sat round the desk, talked and ate.</p>
<p>Xinyi Tong talked about some special mechanism of College Entrance
Examination in Jiangsu province. Then we talked casually
about our research life. There are also some rigid mechanism
during phd life. For students from TBSI it is called "prelim"
and for students from Electronic Department, it is called
"opening topic". Yang Tan talked about his failure
when taking the major "prelim" for the first time.</p>
<p>For other topic, Fei Ma talked about his pursuit --
"getting the phd certificate successfully and timely".
Mingyang Li, Zhiyuan Wu and Ziyan Zheng remained as good
listeners for most time. I mentioned one point of
Weida Wang, who came to our lab when he was at the spring
semester of undergraduate fourth year. For other students,
they enjoyed their times during that undergraduate fourth year.
I thought Weida Wang had great potential as
describing him as "experiencing of phd zero year".</p>
