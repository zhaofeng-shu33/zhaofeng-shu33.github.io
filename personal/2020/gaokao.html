	<h1>Gaokao</h1>
<p>2020/7/7</p>
<p>Today is the first day of delayed College Entrance Examination of China.
Unfortunately, some regional tragedy made it hard for their students
to proceed to the exam spot. In the morning, there is heavy rain in
a small town of Anhui Province and the scheduled exam is delayed
due to irresistible forces. In the afternoon, an accident of bus occurred
in a small town of Guizhou. The bus rushed to the river due to unknown
reasons and there is some senior three students on the bus.
Both incidents are related with bad weather since July is not so good as the
original June for some regions to hold the exam. </p>
