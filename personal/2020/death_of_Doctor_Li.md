# Death of Doctor Li
2020/2/6

I am shocked when I see so many friends comments on this news. It may be a symbol of the ongoing
coronavirus disaster in China. Yesterday a Poland friend and I went back from the discussion meetup
in a Russian restaurant. She asked me whether China blocked some websites and whether people protect.
It is hard to answer such question. But I know there is indeed influence of such policy, of the coronavirus on my life, on the life of each person of China.

We, students at the winter school from China, are worried about the undetermined destiny of the ongoing domestic disaster. Some flights between Russia and China have been canceled. And most of us have to choose Aeroflot, a Russian airplane company to go back. Another phenomenon is that many pharmacy stores have sold out
the wearing masks. It is difficult for us to buy them. And we also worry about whether these masks will be taken away by officials when we enter the territory of China.

To make the story longer, the meeting of high school classmates (4th days after the Chinese new year) is canceled due to the out-break of coronavirus. Although it is impossible for me to be there but it seems a
pity that some classmates reject the invitation politely. Maybe they think the meeting of 4th day is better, rather than joining an official discussion.

Now it seems impossible for us to reunion. Everyone is staying at home. Going out needs mask and the number of mask for most people is insufficient.

It may be an incidence that Doctor Li dies at this time. However, it brings us to reflect on our political system. It seems that we can not do something for it except for knowing it. Someone may think it is enlarging
the tiny problem while others are positively struggling for something. I think reforming by self is also a good choice if we can not change something dramatically. Hope the situation can be better after a few more days.
