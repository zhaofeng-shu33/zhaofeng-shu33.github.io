# Fake News
2020/3/24

In this article, I use Beijing Time.

At around 4:00, thesun.co.uk releases a news titled "What is the Corona/ Covid-19 Virus Really Teaching us?". It is claimed to be a letter written by Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft.

At around 6:17, one We Media of JianShu reprinted [this news](https://web.archive.org/web/20200324161541/https://www.jianshu.com/p/c669f81bff3b), alongside with the Chinese translationï¼Œby 23:59 it has reached 1 million reading hit.

At around 16:00, wntv.uk reprinted this news, with more than 600 reading hit by 23:59.

At around 19:50, wechat "It's American" reprinted this news from JianShu with more than 40 thousand reading hit by 23:59.

I have confirmed at 23:30, thesun.co.uk has removed the article.

At around 23:30, I have searched the official blogs of Bill Gates, his charity foundations, Reddit, Twitter and Facebook. His latest online activity points to March 19th.

I have seen one friend of mine put the link from "It's American" in Wechat Friend Circle.

The contents of the article is not written by Bill Gates, but the tone is imitated on him. And it is easy to cheat readers to get high rading hit.
