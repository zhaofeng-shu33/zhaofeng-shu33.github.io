# Work hard
2020/7/26

Once I read a statement which says "Since people around you work hard, if you do not work hard, you will fall behind. Thus you fell guilty when you relax. This phenomenon can be called
'Intra-Turmoil'".

Yang Bai told me that she had anxiety when she did not work. I also have a little
but not as strong as Yang Bai I think. I think it depends on what you are really
on pursuit. Xinyi Tong told me that if your goal was to get a graduation certificate,
then "working 3 hours a day is enough. The worst consequence is that your phd span
is longer but your life quality is good if you can keep a good state mood.
It is also possible that the worst result may not happen at all."

Another extreme is the anxiety of Fei Ma. From my observation, he always works
and is afraid he could not get the graduation certificate. This is only an excuse
since there is little possibility to fail if you always work.

So what path should I take, I think I should balance between life and work, just as
Jing Li said in his recent blog. By the way, Jing Li is a frontend engineer in Taobao,
who became famous recently because of a gossip. In reality, it is a really hard problem.
On one hand, I have to make sure the efficiency of normal work time. On the other hand,
I have to make sure the purity of leisure time, in which I could learn foreign language, read
books and write articles I like.
