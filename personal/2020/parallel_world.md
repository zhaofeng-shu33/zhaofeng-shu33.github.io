# Parallel world
2020/8/28

Nowadays we sit in one's own seat in the information building.
For me sometimes I wonder the true face of the 2020 female doctor
whose seat is on the right hand of me. Fei Ma also had a female deskmate, Jing Lian. Jian Lian is his study sister but she hasn't
come back to school by now. It is interesting to mention that
when the seat was chosen, Fei Ma wanted to seat beside Jing Lian
and he asked me to seat on the opposite of him. I joked on him to choose Jingyun Yang as the deskmate. He did not make a reply on this
joking and to my surprise, I am the one who seated beside Jingyun Yang.

Jingyun Yang is a female phd student of 2020 grade. From the year 2017,
our lab did not have any female phds until her appearance.
Now the new semester year is beginning, and she will come soon to our lab I think. To my confusion, I did not see her in the past few days.
Another phd male student Jian Liu had appeared for many times.
So what is she doing? In dormitory? I wondered.

As far as I can remember, she had asked some questions on the usage of
our lab server a few months ago during the pandemic time. She managed to install a local git client and update the corresponding documentation. I had intension to recommend her for the server admin in the future. She also
appeared in the WOLT student poster session. However, that day I, with
other doctor students, left early and missed the in-person session time. It is possible to see her pictures from the wechat post articles
of TBSI.

My past deskmate is Shi Lu at iPark. However, it seemed that there is no desk for him in the information building. I packed his computer to
the new lab, preparing for my future deskmate. It is not a so good computer, but I think it is better than nothing. Xinyi Tong told me
that he did not have computers when he came to our lab.

Another future intersection of I and her lies at the fact that I am
the TA of a course given by Professor Yang (Learning From Data) and
she will become a student of this course.

So the problem is that why I am so concerned with her, a girl I am not
familiar with. This kind of thing is not good for my intimate relationship with Yang Bai. Is it because she is beautiful?
Partially true from the photo of that post. The reason I am
determined to chase my ex-girlfriend is partially based on
her outlook and temperament. I have to admit that
sometimes man has fancy illusions and it is dangerous if
it is not controlled properly. Another potential threat to my
intimate relationship is Han Wang. Fei Ma had said that Yang
Bai would definitely part with me if she saw what I had written
on July 15th. In retrospect, it is indeed dangerous if Han Wang
allowed my joining and kept this as a secret to her boyfriend.
Now I understand more why her boyfriend is very angry when Han
Wang told him that she was determined to meet me alone in April.

During that in-person meeting, Han Wang suggested me not to bother
her without emergency. The main reason she gave was that she
and her boyfriend have the privilege to see the dialog of each other.
However, it seems that it is not her own intention.

The last time I contacted her was indeed due to emergency. Seeing
from the result, I appreciate for her very important sentence,
"Say it aloud if you really like that girl. Otherwise, you will
lose the chance forever." No one told me this three years ago to
say it to Han Wang. It is indeed the regret part. However, the lucky
part is that there is some possibility to keep friendship with her
for out whole life.

Two possible things remain. One is the lecture she will give at the YiCheng Library if I could persuade the maintainer of the library.
She would be the doctor of literature, also the "土博士" in Chinese.
Another possibility is the overseas travel, which she also had some
slight promise after she explained the trouble of Northern west travel
to me.

The big program is how to keep balance between the loveship
and friendship with female. Generally speaking, it is nearly
impossible to keep good friend with another female while keeping
a good loveship. You will bring trouble not only to your loveship
but also to the loveship of that girl. So the best choice is
to never reach your so-called good female friend unless emergency.
If contacting is impossible, it will be much better if some third
person is on spot to keep the distance. I think the supervision
is not a bad idea. For example, if in the future I invite Han Wang
to visit our junior Chinese teacher, then there must be a third student, (for example, Chenxi Wang) going together. For the library
part, the library should invite another excellent alumni. For the travel part, I should invite another boy and girl.

Besides in-person meeting, I should avoid contacting the other
electronically without any specific purpose. I have kept this rule
after telling Han Wang my formal relationship with Yang Bai and I think
I can keep it until some emergency happens.

As I learn foreign language every day, I found different natural
language seems to be parallel world. The bridges between different
world are very narrow. If you learn something in another world, for example, comments on a board game, it is hard to bring and share it
in your own language world. Translation is more like a process to create new materials in a world rather than bring something directly
to this world. So mastering several languages will make you become
more lonely since you could not share with others the materials you read in other world.
