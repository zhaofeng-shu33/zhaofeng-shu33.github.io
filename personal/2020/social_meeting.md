# Social meeting
2020/11/22

Tonight I came to Futian to attend a PyData meetup.
I did not know much about this organization until I came there and met
Pedro Baiz, who came from London for business purpose.

Baiz was quite social. From the chat I knew that he was the initializer
of PyData in China and Shenzhen was the only city which had held such meetup.
But to be admitted, the number of organizer in this year's meetup was very limited.
Actually I only saw Jay was hurrying up and down. The activity space provider
also mentioned their background, but they did not do much to help Jay to organize.
Baiz was more focusing on talking with other potential cooperators and maybe he forgot to
help Jay. But you can also understand Baiz as a guest abroad and there was no
convention for the guest to help the host.

After the two talks, Jay invited us to another room for deep discussion.
Some information is shared but too long discussion is harmful I think.
I found there was audience who was not of tech type. He made some startup
business in Shenzhen and was in urgent need of talented people. But
in this era, students after graduation tend to go to big company for a
stable work salary. I knew a youth when I accepted internship at Shunde.
This youth had become an employer of Midea company recently but
was also invited by a boss of local refrigerator maker. The boss promised
to give the same salary as that of Midea if he could come to his company
and described the more promising future. I think what the boss said was
reasonable in the sense that you learned meanly while working in a big
company. But working in a small company had big risk because the company
itself had less ability to resist the fluctuating of market.

The same can be said with startup company in Shenzhen. Besides, I had little
interest in such company because he seemed to know nothing of the technology
behind. The boss talked with me but he used the wrong terminology to refer to
the neural network. It made me think lower of him as a fortune seeker instead
of an entrepreneur. For Baiz himself, he asked me to make a bridge for him to
reach the professors at TBSI for further cooperation. I think what he said about
himself was a little bit exaggerated. Anyway, social people like to brag.

After coming back from the meetup, I was engaged with the preparation of
"Return Teaching". Some good news and more bad news. I think it is actually
the essence of life. Wenting Wei, a 2020 student of PKU agreed to take part in
this activity. However, Li Liu said she could not help much before the
postgraduate entrance examination. The limit contribution of Li Liu was a big blow
I think but there was sufficient reason for her choice. With all those rejections
and small acceptation, I suddenly found the life became more intensive than the
ideal leisure style before. I could not hope for quite tranquil state mind unless
I fall into asleep I think. It is natural for me to dwell on every possibility I
am going to encounter. What if the secretary of the league rejected the activity?
What I am facing with the limited sharing of Li Liu? I could not imagine more.

It was amazing that all these stories came from one sudden thought of myself in a night
a few days ago. It was firstly about my first volunteer leadership in Hainan Wenchang.
Then other stories follow. I could not figure out what is the ending of such story.
But currently, I believed it was a new chapter, not only for the "Return Teaching" activity,
but for a general theme of volunteering.
