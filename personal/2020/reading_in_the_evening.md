# Reading in the evening
2020/12/28

In recent days, I spent almost all evening reading Confucian literature.
It includes the full selection of "Classic of Poetry", selected parts of
"Book of Changes" and "Spring and Autumn Annals". For the last part I
read it along with "Chronicles of the Eastern Zhou Kingdoms".

On Friday evening, Yang Bai called me from Beijing to have some talks by
wechat video. She told me sincerely that I should put more effects into
research. I could not agree with her totally as I thought the pleasant
time was also precious to read systematically something, which may become
impossible in the near future. Indeed, my life view differs from that of
Yang Bai, who treat the success as the goal and push herself forward.
But for me, the goal is no total failure and other "hobbies". Before the
pandemic, I put much time in the software technology besides research.
In this year, I spent more time in learning foreign language and reading
Confucian literature now. I was worried about the future of my relationship
with Yang Bai. Since she told me in a clear tone her unsatisfactory attitudes towards
my divergence and I could not obey her advice, the direct consequence is that
I may not share my "leisure" story with her any more.

But I thought my reading was not by temporary passion but a gradual process. At
first, I took the class of "Path to Poetry", which is a literary course, and
I began to read "Class of Poetry". Then I met Nan Shen and began to read some
history, which led to my start of reading selected works of "Spring and Autumn Annals".
Since there were some divination, I also determine to read essential part of
"Book of Changes". In the meanwhile as I read for several days. I found I needed
some discussions. I searched local communities online and found some hint.

There is still some boundary between normal work and hobby. In daytime of weekday,
I never read Confucian books and put time into research. The problem is that
daytime is often quite limited and I may not accomplish much.

The above note was around personal study, the following was about the preparation of
"Return Teaching". The article to recruit student volunteers has been released and
the place has been checked by the "teacher" Sun, who was the father of 孙硕远. The problem
was how to prepare an online meeting to discuss the arrangement in the next.
