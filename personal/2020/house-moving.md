# House moving
2020/6/28

There is an trainee in our lab. Her name is Ruhui Shen. According to
her original plan, she would live in the university town by renting from
a senior student. However, the coronavirus made the plan fail.
Unfortunately, she had placed some furniture in the dormitory. She was
going to move them out on June 26th. The obstacle is that she
was not permitted to enter the campus through the gate. And it is
hard to bring some heavy things out through some obscure way.
She had asked me for help two weeks ago. But when I asked her on June 25th,
she said she had arranged it well and did not need my help.
The problem is that she asked me again in the evening of June 25th and I
replied that I would be in campus at around 10 a.m.

The annoy part lies at that she did not reply to my message until 11 a.m. when
I was going to have lunch. I asked her the exact position when I was at the canteen
but she did not reply quickly. According to my habit, I need a snap in the noon so
I did not care to tell her I was away for around 1 hour.

She did not plan very well. After I wake up at 12:30 p.m., I received her message
that all was done. Maybe she was also angry with my absence at 12:00 p.m. And we do
not greet each other today even if we both are on the 15th floor of C2 Building, iPark.
