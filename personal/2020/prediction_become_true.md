# Prediction becomes true
2020/7/17

A few months ago, Han Wang asked me why you should wait so long
before admitting officially your relationship with that girl
(Yang Bai). Han said it may be too late before you were realizing it.

Unfortunately, what Han said became reality in a dramatic way.
Indeed, I had planed to express it on 8/25, which was the
Chinese traditional lover's day. This decision was
made a months ago in June. According to
our meeting frequency, about 2 weeks a time, I had enough
time to discuss details about my views, my past and my future plan.
Yang Bai was behaving in a passive but coordinated way and everything
seems to be ok.

There are many underlining problems which made the unmatured relationship
failed. We two are to be blamed.
On my part, the direct reason is that I rejected Yang Bai without
any realization of her intention.

I invited Yang Bai for a supper on my birthday 7/11. The talking
was just as we usually did in the past supper I thought. The
minor difference is the topic.
When we came back to dormitory on the night of 7/11. Yang Bai
asked me to recommend some good boy obeying two rules:

1. Tsinghua student (implying bachalor degree I think)
1. Not so worldy

I misunderstood Yang Bai for her intention and recommended one
person obeying her two conditions. To make things worse, I explained in
the wrong way about why I made the decision. The focus is on the person
I recommended. It originates from one supper and I knew from the super
that there was indeed someone (Xinyi Tong) who was more lofty than me.

The deep reason is really complex. I never prepared well and thought Yang Bai
would behave passatively until I made the final expression first.
However, the problem is that I do not know she is more urgent than me
which leads to the tragedy. Another big problem is that the feeling of
me towards her is not so intense. This is merely calm water and
I think naturally there would be some fruits.

Some other obstacles lies at the fact that there is no one who is both
intimate to me and Yang Bai, which made the turning-back of aftermath
impossible. These are of some advantages for free love but there is indeed
some disadvantages. Initially (at the ending of June) I planed to buy
some flowers on 8/25 and wanted to negotiate with Fei Ma about some
details for that day. However, Yang Bai disliked some parts of Fei Ma and
I then thought it was improper to tell anyone else about my planning.

This week when I sent some messages to Yang Bai she did not reply parts of
them. This is unusual. I thought it may be related with some of my behaviour
which made her think it improper for us to continue.
But which one? I still never thought of her ways of saying "Which one would
you recommend to me?" is a kind of confession instead of testing.
I made a phone call to her on night to explain my decision towards her "testing".
The problem is that I explained first and focused too much on why I recommend
the other person, not on why I did not recommend myself, which was really bad.
I did not realize that Yang Bai was indeed making some kind of confession
until she told me after my talking in an indirect way. I think it is hard
to explain more by myself.
