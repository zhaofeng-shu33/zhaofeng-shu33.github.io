Recently I read again the book "Fortress Besieged".
The first time I read it is when I finished the College
Entrance Exam in the summer of 2013. I remembered
clearly that I read it in the library of my high school.
I did not understand much about this book at that time.
But as times goes, I found some new interest in this novel.

The reading begins when I found Xiangxiang Xu left this
paperback at the lab. Some advantages for me now is that
I could understand parts of the foreign language
mentioned in the book. To my surprise, the new poem
of Miss Su in Chapter 3 is taught at my "Deutsche Unterrricht"
of Level 3. Expect for Italian, I looked some French and English
words used in the book.

Accidentally, recently a love affair is also torturing me a lot.
After putting down some thoughts yesterday, I asked Han Wang
how to deal with this kind of thing on wechat. She said, "You
need to express your love directly. It is more important
than explanations." So I decided to find Yang Bai that night
at about 11:10. She lived at Dormitory 4. I made a lie to
the aunt of the dormitory keeper but failed. She stopped
me from entering the elevator until I told her I wanted
to seek someone living here.

However, Yang Bai and her roommate were not in the room.
I decided to wait and sat down on the steps of stairs.
I read some Japanese news but it was really hard to
know what the news is talking about. The automatic light
overhead went out sometimes; but then went on when I made
some slight actions. The difficulty is that it was quite
hot. Not only the environment but my heart.

I waited about half an hour. During that time, a couple
walked out of the 15th elevator and put strange eyes on me.
There was also a girl stepped out and I did not figure out
whether it was Yang Bai or not. But the instinct pushed me
to utter the name "Yang Bai" while I stood up and walked upwards.
She was turing around the corner when I stood up. And when I
had turned around that corner she was almost in front of
her dormitory. She turned back to find out what's happening
around. She was in white clothes but unfortunately she was
not Yang Bai. An embarrassing situation indeed!

I then decided not to wait any more. Maybe she was at the
lab of Information Building. But it was near 11:40 now.
I then went downstairs by elevator and rushed out of Dormitory 4.
The aunt was recognizing me immediately. Maybe my behavior
is so strange that I left a very deep impression on her.

I knew she should have a seat at the 16th floor of the Information Building.
But to my disappointment, the original seat was appointed to another girl
with her name card. The room of her lab is quite large. Only
a few male students are doing research in the room now. I could not
see very clearly of every seat since I was standing at the outmost side of the lab. But Yang Bai was not in the room.

So where could she be? Maybe she had already slept before 11:10 pm?
I was wondering when I was in the elevator of the Information Building.
So how could I find her and say the very important sentence to her?
Maybe I should find the seat of her in the lab. Maybe she will be 
at the lab tomorrow morning. After thinking of this point, I decided
to go back again to the exact same place on the 16th floor. Still,
I could not find her name card. Maybe she had some special arrangement
on her seat? But it was really hard. I knew nobody of her lab.

When I came out the Information Building. The weather was quite cool but
I felt nothing cool. Another girl in white clothes seemed to be saying goodbye
to a boy and walked inwards to the black background. Is she Yang Bai?
Has she already someone else in love? I knew it was daymare and I could not
resist such stupid thoughts.

I stepped to a T-junction. The left is to playground. The front is to
the dormitory building of Yang Bai (Lotus 4). The right is to my dormitory
building (Lotus 5). I was confused which way to take. Should I
do some running to release my depression? Should I go to Lotus 4 to wait?
Should I go back to my own room and go to bed without any sleeping?

Finally I go to my dormitory. My roommate PengYang Zhao was still playing
computer games. Usually I would hear about his screaming clearly when she
was in extreme mood. But tonight was different. I gave myself a quick
shower and toothbrush. Then I went to bed deciding I had to give a try
tomorrow morning. It was 12pm now. I decided to get up at 6 am.
Usually I put my alarm clock in early time but I always turned it off
since I was sleepy. But this morning was different.

My thoughts are in quite confusion state during the night. I thought
my roommate had gone into deep sleep before me and maybe the air-conditioner
had been in timed shutdown.

Anyway I went up at 6.10 am, to my surprise I did not sleep again.
I seemed to forget my decision in detail but the steps were still clear.
I sent a wechat message to Yang Bai, saying that "I want to give her something. Is that ok?"

Then I went to Pingshan Village directly. Hoping to find some opened flower
store after I finished my breakfast there. The village was still quite
at about 6:30. I seemed to find some ancestral shrine like "文氏祠" or "妈祖庙".
It was quite strange why I did not find them before since I had walked to and from in this village for countless times. Maybe there were always too many people around to cover my eyesight in the past days? Maybe I was a little
bit suspicious this morning? So do I believe in "Yuanfen", a Chinese concept
of probability? In most times the answer is no. But in this special morning,
I thought maybe the answer is yes. I even wanted to go into the shrine to
give some piety postures. But the door was closed.

The flower store was in quite deep and narrow places. They are closed now.
There are 2 stores in the village according to Baidu Map.
According to Meituan, one store said it will resume open after 8 am.
So I decided to wait for about one and a half hours. Yang Bai did not
reply to me by now. She was probability in sleep I think. Or did she think
she had better ignore my message? I decided to proceed without thinking
of what will happen if she rejected me directly.

I stayed at the park in the village and used my smartphone for the help
of learning Japanese. Actually this morning reading did not need any brain.
You proceed by powerful inertia. I read from the text of Lesson 10 to Lesson 30. Anyway people around did not understand the utterance of this foreign language. So it was not so embarrassing. To my surprise,  some workers will
use the fitness equipment casually. Actually they are waiting to
their boss to come. Then they begin their work at about 7:20. There are always
some engineering projects to transform this old village in recent years.
These projects are guided by people with mind but finished by people with physical labour. So why they are still exercise their body even if their main
work is dealing with physical labour. I think this phenomenon is interesting.
Just like some young people are focusing on electronic devices even if their
main work is using electronic devices. You won't feel tired for free use
of electronic device.

The time went very slowly and it was only 7:45. I went again to the two stores
but they were still closed. There were some contact information on the door
but I did not think proper to make a phone call. I decided to go to Xili Town.
Yang Bai stilled not response. Now the sun was rising and it was quite hot when no tree shade was available. Should I take a taxi? But what is the meaning of taking a taxi? I was no so rich to waste money I think.

It was not far from the village to the town. Fortunately the flower store,
called "情意鲜花" was justing opening up at about 8:30.
I told the salesperson my intension. It seems there was not so much to choose from. Either a bunch of dark red rose or sunflower collections.
I think sunflower is probably more proper though it was a little bit dear.
This was the first time I bought the flower in my life and thought it
would be of some meaningful memory regardless the final result.

I called Yang Bai before I entered the subway. It was impossible to take
a bicycle since the bunch of flower can not be reverted.
There is some water within the flowers. I took it carefully and I found
I was changed a little bit and became more polite to the worker of subway,
to the door keeper of Tsinghua and to the students I knew when I waited
in front of Lotus 4.

I decided to tell Yang Bai what my intention was by sending her the picture
when I had arrived at the destination. So there should be some minutes to
consider. Otherwise, she may think I will return the penguin or something else. I think the consideration time is important and I do not want to
let the same tragedy to happen again because of no preparation (7/11).
Yang Bai sent a wechat message to me saying that she was surprised.
I thought there may be some possibility and sent back a love sticker.

During the waiting time, I met Xiangxiang Xu, which was a quite embarrassing thing. But anyway, embarrassment or not is not important at that time since
there was more important thing to do.

I chose to stand in the exact position opposite to the front door of
the building. Bai Yang did not make decoration and seemed
tired when she was coming to me. After her initial greeting, I said
the very important sentence, hoping to melting some ices of
misunderstanding and bring the mutual relationship to a new level.

"Yang Bai, I liked you for a long time. Let us be together, isn't it?"

I even can remember the same meaning in other languages I had tried to keep
up with: Ich liebe dich in German; J'adore tu in French; Я люблю тебя in Russian; 私はあなたを好きです　in Japanese. But I did not think any
necessity to use foreign language. Every dialog is in Chinese.

Yang Bai was also direct. Maybe it benefits from the several minutes
she could form a reply. She told me she would consider
my request sincerely but there was some other trouble she was facing now.
The most urgent is coming from her hometown and there is some bad news.
There may be also some unpleasant things in the company.
I accepted her decision and expressed some admiration for her firm attitude
to troubles. Initially I thought she would not accept my flowers but to
my surprise, she finally accepted it and expressed grand thankfulness to my
kind.

"You know. My mother told me the tragedy just this morning and your phone call
brought me to reality." She said.

"Take care of your tough affair first." I said.

The dialog lasted only for a short minutes. Though no intense reverting
is promised, I think there is some possibility to still keep original relationship before 7/11 night for a while.
