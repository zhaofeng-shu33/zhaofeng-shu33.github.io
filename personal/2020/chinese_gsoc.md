# Chinese GSOC
2020/6/30

This year there is an activity called "Light-Up of Software Development", hosted by Chinese
Academy of Science. This is similar to Google Summer of Code except for its localization for
Chinese university students. I have also applied for one project, launched by tuna.

I did not expect too much of this kind of activity and wrote some existing works of others
in my application form. Not to my surprise, I am rejected. But to my surprise, the one
who was chosen is exactly the person whose existing work has been found by me. He is
more better than me at this project since he is already debian developer. But he has
applied to GSOC of this year, so how can he earn the "double" money from both US and China?

Today is the last day of the trainee, Ruhui Shen at our lab. She said farewell to me and students
of 1C. I also explained a little about the possible misunderstanding during her "house moving".
She talked a little about her sad story during that day: a non-critical car incident on their return
way to home in Huizhou. She is quite out-going and goes along with students of other labs as well.

The closed status of campus has occupied the whole June and is continuing to July. No one knows
what the leaders think just as we do not know why the cinemas were still closed. With closed cinemas,
the attraction of shopping malls is reduced.

I am still confused with the compressed mechanism of data for wechat windows and it is impossible
to back up materials other than text message. I give a try today but without results. I think I have to
learn again some reverse engineering knowledge before I can succeed to figure out a way.
