	<h1>Call Yicheng library</h1>
<p>2020/12/19</p>
<p>This Friday afternoon, I called fixed telephone of Yicheng library.
My purpose is to recommend the speaker Wang Han to give a lecture
on some literature topic. As was expected, the secretary herself
could not make the decisions. She said she would contact
the library master and if there was some progress, I would receive
the callback. Such things often have little probability to succeed,
even Yicheng is my hometown and a small place. There was very few
lectures held by this library due to its closeness and backward pace.</p>
<p>Kind behavior is not always rewarded. Calling library is one thing.
Organizing the return teaching activity is another thing. After
some careful consideration, I made a conclusion that there was little
probability to get a good place to held the return teaching activity
and the best choice left is to abandon the on-going plan. It is
strange to say that the vast Yicheng could not tolerate a tiny
desk.</p>
