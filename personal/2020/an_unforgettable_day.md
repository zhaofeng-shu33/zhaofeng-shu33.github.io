# An unforgettable day
2020/7/23

Today is the unforgettable day for me and I think there is
a breakthrough of relationship between I and Yang Bai.
In the past few days, I am worried about that Yang Bai
will told me that she thinks it is not suitable for us
to be together. But now, such probability is quite low
and I think we could start a new chapter together.

I hesitate a lot before asking whether we could meet in
person this weekend. She said yes and told me that
today she would come earlier from the company due to
menses. She likes to watch soup operas when in low mood
and sleeps a lot. She asked me what am I doing.

Me: I am reading a book containing the sentence, "
Du bist verschlossen in meinem Herzen;
verloren ist das Schl√ºsselein."

YB: some adolescence literature?

Me: Sentences translated by Qian Zhongshu.

YB: All right. I am guessing you are reading some kind of book.
I only read "Fortress Besieged".

Me: The sentence is exactly from this book!

YB: Wow. I guess it may be some poem between Fang Hongjian and Tang Xiaofu.

Me: How could you remember so clearly even the figures in the book?

YB: I read them in my early years. The impression
is also deep. It's really a happy thing to treasure such things.
