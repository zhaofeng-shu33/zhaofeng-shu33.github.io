# Aftermath of cheating
2020/11/13

I discussed with my roommate about the manner to report the improper
behavior of that cheating student. At first I thought the difficulty
lay at the protection umbrella of the other TA. But after the night,
I found Weida Wang also changed. He did not show the tendency to protect
the student any more. After I reported the case to professor Yang,
I found Yang also changed. She thought no need to punish the student
severer than others. Maybe after the turbulence of recent days, professor
Yang was also tired.
