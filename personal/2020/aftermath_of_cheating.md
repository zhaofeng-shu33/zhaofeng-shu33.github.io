# Aftermath of cheating
2020/11/13

I discussed with my roommate about the manner to report the improper
behavior of that cheating student. At first I thought the difficulty
lay at the protection umbrella of the other TA. But after the night,
I found Weida Wang also changed. He did not show the tendency to protect
the student any more. After I reported the case to professor Yang,
I found Yang also changed. She thought no need to punish the student
severer than others. Maybe after the turbulence of recent days, professor
Yang was also tired.

Recently I was taking the course "Poetic paths", which was a humanity  
course for undergraduate students of HITSZ. The professor, Asha Huang
talked about the "Fields and Gardens poetry" this week. When talking
about Tao Qian's famous lyric, "I pluck chrysanthemums under the eastern hedge,
Then gaze long at the distant summer hills." (translated by Arthur Waley)
Huang said, why could we take walks in the campus of HIT and gaze at the Mount of
Tang Lang? ("漫步哈工大，悠然见塘朗山。" in Chinese)
