	<h1>Fake News</h1>
<p>2020/3/24</p>
<p>In this article, I use Beijing Time.</p>
<p>At around 4:00, thesun.co.uk releases a news titled "What is the Corona/ Covid-19 Virus Really Teaching us?". It is claimed to be a letter written by Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft.</p>
<p>At around 6:17, one We Media of JianShu reprinted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200324161541/https://www.jianshu.com/p/c669f81bff3b">this news</a>, alongside with the Chinese translation，by 23:59 it has reached 1 million reading hit.</p>
<p>At around 16:00, wntv.uk reprinted this news, with more than 600 reading hit by 23:59.</p>
<p>At around 19:50, wechat "It's American" reprinted this news from JianShu with more than 40 thousand reading hit by 23:59.</p>
<p>I have confirmed at 23:30, thesun.co.uk has removed the article.</p>
<p>At around 23:30, I have searched the official blogs of Bill Gates, his charity foundations, Reddit, Twitter and Facebook. His latest online activity points to March 19th.</p>
<p>I have seen one friend of mine put the link from "It's American" in Wechat Friend Circle.</p>
<p>The contents of the article is not written by Bill Gates, but the tone is imitated on him. And it is easy to cheat readers to get high rading hit.</p>
