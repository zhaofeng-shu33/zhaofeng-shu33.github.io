# Incident of travel
2020/7/15

This incident happened yesterday when I looked through the wechat moments casually
and saw suddenly the travel companion seeking message from Han Wang.

She said She was going to Northern West of China. I was shocked by this message
because I had the intermediate tendency to travel together. But I was also
hesitating. Was she going with her boyfriend? Should I bother her with some
messages since there may be further displeasure of her boyfriend because of my past special
relationship with her?

I checked the message half an hour later and found this moment had been deleted.
I cannot resist ask Hang Wan directly about whether she was going to travel.
She replied with certainty but the difficulty was that she had not companion yet.

I thought we can form a group of 4 students but the difficulty is that the original
airline ticket is tomorrow. I said it was too hurry to ask others about this kind
of thing. Han said maybe her parents will accompany her.

I thought a lot during lunch. One possibility, also a dangerous one is that I am
asking for the opportunity. Then the hard decision had to be made by her.
I said it was ok if we could keep some distance during travel. The dramatic part
of this thing is that she said her mother had booked the ticket a few minutes
ago. So I had to give some wish of good trip to her and her mother.

This incident brought again some hard problems back to me. I knew it was
nearly impossible for me to win the heart of Han Wang. She will spend at
least three years in FuDan University as a literary Ph.D. student. And I am
at Shenzhen and maybe seek a job nearby after graduation. She had boyfriend
now and I also have established some kind of intimate friendship with Yang Bai.
Though we were very near during spring festival, both at ZaoZhuang. The problem
is that there were some restrictions even we can meet offline. There are some
hope that we may form a group with other students for an oversea trip after
the pandemic or she would seek a job in GuangDong province when her boyfriend
was reading Ph.D. in HongKong. But these are some distance hope and I thought
this incident of travel proves again the mismatch of I and her. Each one of us
will have own life travel and there is little possibility of crossover in the future.
