	<h1>Diary of Fangfang</h1>
<p>2020/6/24</p>
<p>This is a social event about the reaction of people towards the diary of Fangfang.
The event sparked on April this year. Some of my friends think there is some
problem with the writer Fangfang herself. I did not fully agree with opinions of theirs.
After the hot wind is gone, I will write down what I think about this event.</p>
<p>This is a really complex topic on how Chinese people think about the world.
Nowadays there is acute discriminations. Some are going upwards while some are going downwards.
The social status pyramid is emerging. Fangfang is definitely at a relative top level in the pyramid and her behaviour of selling books abroad is easy to be interpreted to grab more fame for herself. One proof of the wrong doing of Fangfang lies at the fact that she owned 8 houses in Wuhan. The anti-rich mind in Chinese common people is an important factor which contributes to the negative attitude of most people.</p>
<p>Another factor is the longtime educational bias. From childhood we were told that China is in a quite dangerous position, surrounded by anti-Chinese strength overseas. What Fangfang had done is easier to be interpreted to cooperate with these bad gangs and will potentially harm our country. Even though it is not the original idea of Fangfang, she is still to blame for her
unintentional consequences.</p>
<p>To be honest, I think making some documentation is less effective than helping others in need directly. </p>
