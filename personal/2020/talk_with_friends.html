	<h1>Talk with friends</h1>
<p>2020/8/6</p>
<p>Today it was sunny. It's unusual since it rained for several days.
I went to climbing alone after work. When I was on the road
up, I recalled some past events, long before I came to Shenzhen.
The girls I had pursued, the friends I met and parted and the
teachers which left impressions on me. Some events seemed to happen
yesterday. However, it was impossible to go back. When we were
in the same city, it there some possibility to reunion and talk
freely and heartily? It was easy and hard. The easy part is that
it took little time and money to meet the other. The difficult part
is that I did not have enough motivation to do so. It seemed that
the life path of I and the other diverges. Why bothers to make the
paths join for a short time again? It was indeed a hard choice.</p>
<p>After I returned to school, I wanted to find some friends to have
a talk. I even did not bother what the topic was. But it is obvious,
with Xinyi Tong the topic is politics and ancient Chinese characters,
with Zhiyuan Wu the topic is software technology and deep learning architecture,
with Fei Ma the topic is quite realistic. Actually I felt the problem
was probability the zero initializer of the weight. But I still went for
Zhiyuan Wu to debug the problem together. Man is lonely and needs some
opportunity to bother good friends without notice in advance.</p>
