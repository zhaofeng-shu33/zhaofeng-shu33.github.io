Pearson is a great mathematician and he proposed a concept
called "Mean Square Contingency" in one of his [treatise](https://archive.org/stream/cu31924003064833#page/n1/mode/2up).
This concept can describe the relationship between two random
variables. Pearson's original formulation
is using discrete random variables. Many years later, one
paper([Gebelein-1941](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/zamm.19410210604)), which is cited by Xiangxiang Xu in his journal article published
recently(2020) said this contingency method can only be used in discrete
form. However, Pearson used this concept and computed the contingency for
2d normal distribution, which means it can be generalized to continuous case easily.

The original article of Gebelein said in his first part:
"
Sein Nachteil besteht darin, daß $f^2$ sich nur für arithmetische Verteilungen bilden läßt und daß, wie sich später zeigt, eine sinnvolle
Verallgemeinerung auf Verteilungsfunktionen $w(x, y)$ überhaupt nicht möglich ist.
"

This article has no references but is cited for more than 200 times since its publication. I wonder whether it is truly valuable as it gave misleading information when introducing previous work. I know you need to give some disadvantage summary for one particular previous work. But
can we make up some non-existing fact?
