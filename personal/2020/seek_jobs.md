# Seek jobs
2020/7/1

A few months ago, I have removed Huawei from my job list due to some unpleasant social event.
However, as times goes by, I have to admit Huawei plays an important role in the attraction of big company.
There is a popular word called "inner turbulence" (内卷), which describes the intense competition of seeking mentorship and jobs for university students.

I am no longer adolescent any more and indeed young adult by the age. The life value tends to be more
realistic. Yang Bai often mentioned the great peer pressure she felt when she worked in Tencent as a trainee.
Fei Ma treated me as "academic equivalence" and pushed himself to work harder. These kind of things will also
influence me and make us more similar.

Without accident, we need to give out our CV to many companies one year later. There are also
some other choices like seeking a teacher position in university or seeking a post-doctor position aboard.
But these choices are of less advantages. The life is full of indeterminacy.
