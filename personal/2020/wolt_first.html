	<h1>WOLT first</h1>
<p>2020/7/20</p>
<p>So today is the first day of the 2nd TBSI workshop
on Learning Theory. This workship was helt in the
hall of Shenzhen Institute for talents development.
I headed there with friends by taxi early this morning
for the assistance of entrance as volunteers. However,
there was few people on spot. Most speakers
will give a talk online. Actually, it has been
a long time since I attended academic activity
as an audience. When I was listening the talk,
my mood was tranquil. Actually, a little boring I think.
Maybe in my inner heart, I am still with constant worry about
my near future, worry about my research and my relationship
with Yang Bai. She said she was very busy recently
but I was not busy.</p>
<p>So what happened yesterday between she and I?</p>
<p>It was hard to recollect something you feel exhausted and
not everything was happening according to your plan.
The first temporary decision made by me yesterday noon
was about making an appointment of dining with her at the school canteen.
Anyway there may be some chance for an appointment this weekend. But
for yesterday, Yang Bai said she had no time and would think
carefully next week. Maybe she thought I was still impatient
for her precise attitude. I think there is still a little bit hope
for our relationship but I am not sure.</p>
<p>So how my attitude changed sharply? This may traces back to what
Han Wang told me as a catalyst:</p>
<p>"If you loved a person, please say it loudly. Missing this period
may be equivalent to missing forever."</p>
<p>So I will be upset when there was no reply from her towards one of my message
for a few hours. This may be normal in the past but I felt it different now.</p>
<p>Recently I also send a lot of messages to the groups of lab doctors.
I think I need a way to let out some of my feelings. Multi-channel message
is my way.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I could absorb myself into research for a little while.
But when I am walking out of iPark tonight. My feeling is transformed to be
sensitive of the world around. I saw many things I neglected in the past.
There are workers who are earning money in the night when we are relaxed.
I am also a little bit tired of the prosperity of the big city. Young people
are so busy that when they are having fun, they also did it in an unhealthy way.</p>
