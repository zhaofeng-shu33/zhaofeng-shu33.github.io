	<h1>Sex Assault</h1>
<p>2020/4/15</p>
<p>Recently in China there is a hot news telling about a man with high social status make sex
assault on her adopted daughter for three years. It triggers the anger of most Chinese
people. As for the matter itself, there is little doubt on its bad characteristics.
As for me, though I am a male, I am told by other ladies about their experiences.
The one is from my ex-girlfriend, who was assaulted by university professor when
she was an undergraduate. The other is from a team member of volunteer teaching when
we were in HaiKou. At that time, I had little experience in organizing activities
and actually the tour is not a good choice since we have stayed on the train for 36 hours.
Everyone is very sleepy when we are on the bus. And one lady was assaulted at about noon.
She did not tell us until late evening and another bad thing also happened: her iphone was
stolen when we were about to get on a bus. I asked her politely why she did not call for others'
help immediately since we are all on the bus. I had forgotten the exact answer of her. Maybe
she was worried about the loss when everybody in the team knew about this thing.</p>
<p>My mother also told me her experience when I was very young. Luckily the guy was pretty timid
and ran away when my mother cried for others' help.</p>
<p>It seems that it was quite common of sex assault in our society. Actually it was also common
overseas. In the eyes of western media, our country did not treat such matter well as so many
incidents are ignored. Therefore, when they reported the "China lawyer Sex Assault Incident",
they also expressed the general worry about the missing of penalty in China.</p>
<p>The matter is one part. The other part is that the media to report such thing seems a
little bit emotional. I do not say emotional news is not proper. But it may not be true
when dealing with much detail. It is reported literature but not latest news. In this sense,
CaiXin is better than Southern Wind Windows, since the latter told a story instead of news.
But the report of CaiXin is not neutral and follows the narrative of the last big event "JD CEO sex assault incident".</p>
<p>Currently the JD CEO event is beneficial to CEO due to released fact. But maybe it should be neutral. The lady also has high social status compared with common people but is far less than
the CEO. This status imbalance did not allow the neutral result. It is a tragedy, I think.</p>
<p>During the world war, Switzerland maintains neutral country not because it would do so but it was able to do so. Conquering Switzerland has little benefits but huge loss for other warring countries. We can say there is a kind of balance of power and it is the pre-condition of keeping
neutral.</p>
<p>When keeping neutral is impossible, the truth is almost lost. Lawyer Bao can overwhelm the girl but the power of social critics can overwhelm him. All are of very imbalance power.</p>
<p>As for me, I am also thinking about my position in the society. Indeed I can overwhelm many people but also can be overwhelmed by some others. Maybe I can only find friends among the people
who have the similar social position. If someone of upper position gives me a hand, I am likely to be controlled by him. If I give me a hand to someone lower to me, I am probably controlling him. It is better not to bother people who have different level of positions except for necessity.</p>
