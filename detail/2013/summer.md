## 如风读小园赋

草无忘忧之意，花无长乐之心。也是庾信的小园赋中的，比起欣赏语言，如风更倾向思想。

刚看了一遍小园赋，典故大多不知何意，对我们来说，读赋是一件很不轻松的事。除了苏东坡的前后赤壁赋外，如风熟悉的就是洛神赋和芙蓉女儿诔（很像赋体），相比而言，如风总对小园赋用的韵没有感觉，不像洛神"抗罗袂以掩涕兮，泪流襟之浪浪"更让如风感到音韵之美。

龟言此地之寒，鹤讶今年之雪，确实有亡国的哀音。这句在小园赋末段出现，前几句写昔，

反观当下，让庾信不禁感慨日月如梭，韶华不再（百灵兮倏忽，光华兮已晚）。不过如风没有什么共鸣，倒是觉得"风骚骚而树急"用来形容现实中自己看到的坛山上的树的动态颇有新意。

##　东坡四年黄州住

苏东坡 Su was going to leave 黄州 Huangzhou.At a farewell dinner,a female entertainer came up and asked him to write a poem for her.Though Su had stayed there for four years,he had never heard of this entertainer,LiQi,李淇.He asked her to grind the ink and took up the brush and wrote:

Four years has DongPo lived at Huangzhou,

Strange that he never mentioned LiQi;

Exactly like DuFu 杜甫 of the West River,

Of the best flower,begonia,he sang the least.

东坡四年黄州住，何事无言及李淇？

恰似西川杜工部，海棠虽好不留诗。

如风读时的想法，诗是夸对方的，却不留痕迹，甚是巧妙。杜甫在西川这个地方住时，咏了很多花，但没咏海棠花。这并非说明海棠不美，也许是太美而让大诗人没法用诗来形容。

林语堂的翻译很善于用倒装的手法，若写成

DongPu has lived four years.It's strange that he never mentioned LiQi.But the case is exactly like that of DuFu.He didn't croon begonia,which is of the best flower.

也索然无味了。

## zeal against popery

读书应有这样的精神：

欧洲宗教改革后，原来的旧教势力仍十分强大，美国著名人物Franklin回忆他的祖先的文字是这样的：

My obscure ancestors joined early in the Reformation 宗教改革,and
they continued (to be)Protestants 新教徒 when they were sometimes in danger of trouble on account of their zeal against popery 旧的教皇势力.

They had got an English Bible.(旧的教皇势力只允许拉丁文版的，由于一般人看不懂，所以他们曲解圣经）

In order to conceal and secure the book,
it was fastened(with tapes) underneath a stool.
When my great-great-grandfather read it to his family,
he turned over the stool upon his knees.
One of the children stood at the door to give notice if the apparitor came.In that case the stool was turned upon the floor immediately,so that the Bible remained concealed as before.

如风认为，这是信仰的力量。

对于文字，如风觉得有一些很别扭的表达，我擅自给改了。比如，第一行的
join 原文是 was.

用zeal这个名词表现反对的程度，而用介词against引出反对的对象，不落窠臼。 

## 外貌描写

关于外貌描写：

Franklin 这样形容自己的爹，

He had an excellent constitution of body,was of middle stature,but well set...he was skilled a little in music,and had a clear,pleasing voice...he had a mechanical genius too...but his great excellence lay in a sound understanding and solid judgment in  affairs ,so that leading people in the town frequently consulted his for his opinion in affairs of the town.

如风本来觉得看这种概括性的描述很无聊，但若自己试着仿写……

Meimei has an excellent constitution of body,was of middle stature,but perfectly set...she is skilled quite a lot in English,and had a sharp,acurate institution to English listening.
But her great excellence lies in ______(please fill the blank).
I want to consult her for her heading university...

好吧，前几句你改成将来时。 

## 荒唐

天真岁月

Franklin 曾回忆自己作为孩子王带头做的一件“错事”。

There was a salt marsh that bounded part of the millpond(贮水池），on the edge of which ,at high water,we used to stand to fish fot minnows(一种鱼）.By much trampling,we had made it a mere quagmire(
沼泽地）.My proposal was to build a wharf there fit for us to stand upon,and I showed my comrades(用词很正式啊）a large heap of stones,which were intended for(building) a new house near the marsh,and which would very well suit our purpose.Accordingly,in the evening,when the workmen were gone(be gone,很常见，好像人走就是be gone,但这里如风倒是想出workmen were forced to go due to darkness),I assembled (自己俨然一领导）a number of my playfellows,and working with them diligently like so many emmets(ants),sometimes two or three to(carrying) a stone,we brought them all away and built our little wharf.(他们也不怕天黑，陷沼泽里如何是好）The next morning...

即使是我们，也不好评判对错，不知小Franklin事先是否知道那些stones的用途。

但这其中体现的他的leadership，难道能说和他日后的政治外交事业没有关系吗？

这的确可算是Franklin天真岁月的一件荒唐事，但我们隔着近300年的时间回望，却觉得这件事情不仅有趣，也颇有意义。

但对此事来说，作为家长的教育方式可就很关键了，如风这里不妨设个问，如果你是Franklin的家长，你会如何做？

设想比现实肯定美妙多了，越是荒唐的事，越容易在别人虚构的作品里发生，实写自己的现实和身边的事就觉得平淡，但如风却觉得关乎“荒唐”，也值得一写，在开学前，如风想以此文与自己的过往对话一番。

不知伦有何思路可以给如风以启迪？

# 读书条件

Franklin小时候读书的环境可不妙：

I was put to a grammar school.However,he scarcely continued  a year when my father, from a view of the expense of a college education ,which having so large a family he could not afford,and the mean living many so educated were after graduation able to obtain,altered his first intention,took me from the grammar school and let me assist him in his business.

小时候我们总听到名人少时在艰苦的环境中刻苦学习的故事，但Franklin只是客观叙述他的这一段经历，少了主观的渲染更引起了如风理性的思考：
客观环境并不能决定一切。

但分析上面的第二句话才更是关键所在：

he scarcely...when...是如风改的，原文讲的还具体到了年级等情况。
expense and living 是并列关系，它们分别有一个定从修饰。

expense which he could not afford 和 living (that) many people obtain

但作者Franklin倾向于把状语放在令我们很不习惯的位置，这大概是时代的差异。
having family 逻辑主语是 my father,而 after graduation(原文是 afterward)又被放在了一个割裂系表结构的位置。

第二句大意是说父亲考虑到学费（Franklin 有十几个兄妹）和很多大学生上完还是 mean living，就改变了初衷（让我上大学），让我帮他打点生意。
