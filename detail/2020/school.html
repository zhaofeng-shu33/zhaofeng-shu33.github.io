	<h2>Going out</h2>
<p>2020/5/22</p>
<p>It is hard to go out of the campus in recent days. I have to find some obscure way along
the Dasha River. Still, the field workers stop me when I come back. They warn that I
can't do such thing any more.</p>
<h2>Reunion</h2>
<p>2020/5/26</p>
<p>Reunion with partial members of 2018 summer volunteer teaching students
since Shaoping is going to leave the campus tomorrow.

<h2>Eating with lab members</h2>
<p>2020/6/25</p>
<p><img alt="" src="./images/reunion1.jpg" /></p>
<h2>Climbing</h2>
<p>2020/7/15</p>
<p>This is the second time I went to TangLang Mountain with my roommate, Pengyang Zhao.
Usually I went climbing once a time every weak.</p>
<h2>Poem</h2>
<p>2020/7/16</p>
<p>When I went to iPark this morning, a poem flowed to my mind:</p>
<p>曾幻年来事非空
笔底飞鸿已无踪
春风杨柳花开日
粉面桃花人不同</p>
<h2>Eating with lab members</h2>

<h2>Split of Life and Study</h2>
<p>2020/8/3</p>
<p>This night I said to my roommate PengYang Zhao,
"In most time I studied in lab and
take rest in our dormitory."
"No, you should say, 'I take rest in the upper and
study in the lower.'" Peng replied.</p>
<p>Some background information: our bed is on the upper part of
the furniture in the dormitory.</p>
<h2>Delivery</h2>
<p>2020/8/4</p>
<p>This noon when I was in the elevator of C2 Building, iPark.
I heard,
" 美女你到十四楼吗，能帮忙把这个（外卖）放前台吗，谢谢，我打电话给他。"</p>
<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>2020/11/11</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/thanks.png" /></p>
<h2>Missing</h2>
<p>2020/11/16</p>
<p>信息大楼保安的问好，
荷一食堂的支付成功，
宿舍楼前门禁的谢谢，
都不如听到你
让我如沐春风</p>
<p>男生节的横幅，
电脑里的程序，
各式的菜肴，
都不如看见你
让我心驰神往</p>
<p>学外语的新奇
做科研的奥妙
读诗歌的典雅
都不如想到你
让我全神贯注</p>
<h2>Teaching others</h2>
<p>2020/11/17</p>
<p>Teaching others will not always improve yourself. I am again touched by such view when preparing a tutorial on the principle of neural network. This slide is intended for a meetup of a regional data science group.
I think the problem with routine lies at the
stale impression of knowledge.
When I am quite familiar with something, I will get tired.</p>
<h2>a poem in dream</h2>
<p>2020/11/18</p>
<p>浚江东上阻 河化入清流</p>
<p>欲留人之意 不复旧时书</p>
<h2>a poem after wake in the morning</h2>
<p>2020/11/19</p>
<p>春时去已尽 秋日水流长</p>
<p>还将旧时意 怜取眼前人</p>
<h2>Dreaming the wars of the Roses</h2>
<p>Yesterday I had a dream. In the dream, I went into a cultural shop and bought a souvenir coin memorizing "Wars of the Roses". The coin itself is quite expensive.</p>
<h2>Crying for parents</h2>
<p>2020/12/9</p>
<p>In the "Classic of Poetry" (诗经), there is a poem called
（日月）, in which a lady is crying for her parents. Some
reviewers thought it was natural for human to cry for parents
when they were in trouble. I remember a similar thing happened
in USA when George Floyd was stroked by a police. He also cried
for her mother in the video clip.</p>
