## Going out
2020/5/22

It is hard to go out of the campus in recent days. I have to find some obscure way along
the Dasha River. Still, the field workers stop me when I come back. They warn that I
can't do such thing any more.

## Climbing

This is the second time I went to TangLang Mountain with my roommate, Pengyang Zhao.
Usually I went climbing once a time every weak.

## Poem
2020/7/16

When I went to iPark this morning, a poem flowed to my mind:

曾幻年来事非空
笔底飞鸿已无踪
春风杨柳花开日
粉面桃花人不同
