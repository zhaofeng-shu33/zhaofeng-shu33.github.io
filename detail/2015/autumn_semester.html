	<h2>大一新生所作之宣传活动板</h2>
<p>中有一词如下：</p>
<p>纪念抗战胜利七十周年</p>
<p>八年苦难 葬多少华夏英烈</p>
<p>危存亡 风也飘摇 雨也飘摇</p>
<p>平型雁门关破阵</p>
<p>淞沪长沙城喋血</p>
<p>惊回首 弹指七十年耻未雪</p>
<p>舞纸鸢 感韶华</p>
<p>抚霜鬓 叹流年</p>
<p>问英灵安在 后生可缅？</p>
<p>几缕忠魂酣醉后</p>
<p>丰功传烈怎忘却</p>
<p>问苍天 那弹丸倭寇 何时灭</p>
<h2>百度外卖</h2>
<p>2015/8/27</p>
<p>在宿舍楼门口看到了有身着百度外卖的送货员。 </p>
<h2>Talk with sister Peng</h2>
<p>2015/10/18</p>
<p>Today I talked with study sister Peng about one fundamental problem, national identity. The approach is historical geography. Another voice told me that the consumption of time on this unbounded problem should be limited. Words can have a tunnel to go out. However, this kind of releasing is a kind of social activity. Oral communication has its advantages alongside with its enormous disadvantages. Young strength appeals for appropriate social activities. But this kind of appeal may be an illusion.</p>
<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>2015/12/5</p>
<p>At this very point of La vie, it is not easy to tell what it means that I can not find partners to do something different. Because of the failure of application for SRT in the last part of this semester, the process for software development stagnated. I have to say it is very hard to cooperate without a powerful organization like those clubs or students’ committee. Though they do routine jobs, it runs on well because they have a well-defined space---regulation, activity room and ways. But for other informal or temporary “team”, we are always busy for coursework first. To be worse, the activity has no fixed period. We can even not fix a time to work on together. All these drawbacks plus my inexperience leads to my now uncomfortable situation, both physical and psychological. On one hand, the unauthorized black email way is very impolite to express oneself, and even common friends will ignore your plunged email without notice. Same situation applies to other social media, point-to-point targeting is very torturing and produces little result. On the other hand, the redirection for new creation in second language education is totally irrelevant to studies of science as a whole, which means I have to balance or even quit one of them even in the next semester. All in all, there is little hope to receive any definite reply from either the application for one 教育技术兴趣团队 or getting the feedback of my invitation about one winter vacation project.</p>
