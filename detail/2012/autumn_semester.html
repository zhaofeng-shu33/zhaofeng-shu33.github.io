	<h2>Simple life</h2>
<p>2012/8/15</p>
<p>I'm preparing for physics and math contests recently, thus racking my mind. Maybe I feel the same as you a year ago at these hard exercises. At the same time, I spared some time reading and writing, all related to paper, not screen. As for the contents of my reading, parts are concerned with music and art, which also low my spirit. The rest are famous books. The main purpose of my reading is for further improvement of test scores, especially Chinese literature and the basic skills. The efforts, which I can't see, may be small. But I gradually indulge in literature including the Dream of the Red Chamber and Jane Eyre. This is my simple life at this specific time.</p>
<h2>English class</h2>
<p>2012/9/18</p>
<p>Going through the process of revising basic knowledge,
some teachers are critical about many kinds of petty errors made by us.
What we have memorized often corresponds with the sentences printed on
the textbook. Then Mrs leads us to a state of condemning ourselves.
While we are musing on our blunders, pushing us too hard seems insensible. Future is always turned over as a new page, in which
we will inattentively read if we dwell on the agony of the past.</p>
<h2>English class representative Tai</h2>
<p>2012/9/20</p>
<p>Sun Shoutai showed me his new diary book, it said "Though
the wheel of years pushed us forward, though the tunnel of times buries our past, though the eternal truth accelerates our growing adolescence and makes our naive countenance lost..."</p>
<p>Guy Tai had hardly given the listening paper away when the music rang.
He got so anxious as to fling a pile towards the front row. As we
predicted, some back students would nearly missed the beginning but
for Tai's timely distribution.</p>
<h2>P.E. class</h2>
<p>2012/10/24</p>
<p>We seemed to get a free chance to escape from the monotonous sitting lifestyle. Though for just a while, after concealing two-week-long
P.E. lessons, we, represented by Chu Liang, ran downstairs with high glee. It was a quirk of fate that all the students present -- except
for injured students. As I can recollect, some basketball fans were still hiding under their quilts, attesting their hard-work
till very late time, but they would appear just before the ball game.
It was unusual in October to experience such a sweltering afternoon, in
which the natural creatures listless and the playground crowded with lively adolescents. To our dismay, the P.E. teacher bid our masculine boys "carry the stand (connected with recent sports meeting) to the bottom of the national flag pole." We rubbed our limbs, envying Wang Zhen, who led the remaining female fellows running a circle (We have a great view besides the second floor window, in the stadium). Much to
our dismay when the stand was found, three of us were equal enough to bear the porter-like errand.</p>
<h2>Teaching another class</h2>
<p>2012/11/8</p>
<p>The other day Mrs Wei gave a public lesson to Class 13 Senior 3 in the western part of No.1 School. She was not accustomed to the negative
atmosphere at all. Most students lost their books and were at a loss
at the given paper. A student seated in the front, whispered to Mrs,
"Please not ask me questions, Madam. I'm not a little poor in English.
As you look, I'm reviewing from the junior high content." He was
absolutely a standard example a standard example of his class. They even
can't find the phrases pointed by Mrs because they can't tell by
the pronunciations. It's totally a tough task for teachers to take up
teaching such students. Once a student admired Mrs, he called her
Missis. "Whoever she teaches now can easily get a grade over 120."
How can it be true? What if Mrs taught another bands of students?
She had no possibility of reaching the same effect, even if she
overworked.</p>
<p>This is an experience which Mrs Wei shared her experience with us.
I retorted the story to the notebook. I don't intend to embody the
superiority of us by comparison as we also had lots of defects.
I wrote down an English composition too fast to think over details.
Is it possible that we will make progress while we always finish work in our usual way?</p>
<h2>Free wind's trouble</h2>
<p>2012/11/16</p>
<p>Thank you for reading my absurd letter with patience. I will
feel a little better as I put my experiences down even though
you always keep silent in the distance. I have never imagined
a hard time at the special class which contains only 33 students,
among whom there are no naughty boys, impolite gys and proud
girls. Does too ideal environment often cause problems?
At first I can study in the room with a quiet mind but recently
the balance was broken. My efficiency was passively
lowered down and I often feel myself in a dungeon with a
ruffled mind. Though I keep taciturn as usual, the inner part
speaks louder, saying all the useless trivialities which
baffled me much.
I suspected the symptoms as mental problems so I take
measures to resist them. I went to bed at 11:30 and listened
to music for a long time. However, it worked little. Then I,
with heavy packages, walked into the exam room, then made a
series of mistakes, including unfinished Chinese composition and nearly forgetting smearing subject on the reply card. Even though at the English exam, I can't
distinguish one expression from another, whose meanings are similar.
I feel I will break down when the short vocation came to an end.</p>
<h2>Depressed</h2>
<p>2012/11/18</p>
<p>At the first class of Monday, I suddenly felt depressed.
State mind is above all other things...</p>
<h2>Morning Reading</h2>
<p>2012/12/10</p>
<p>I changed my style of morning reading, the new way of which seemed crazy.
Speed is put for the top priority. As for English, I found more expressions
you didn't know how to use though you knew the meaning. Change is
a long process and ought to consist of no anxiety.</p>
<h2>Authority</h2>
<p>2012/12/11</p>
<p>Which part can one hold tightly in mind? piles of words tortured us in
Chinese class. I often forgot what I was reading and what purpose I hold.
If one experienced more or read more, could he have more unusual life
level? Our physics teacher claimed that Wang Weijia became an authority
of our class, as his answers to physics questions have more persuasion
than the teacher's.</p>
<h2>Printing room</h2>
<p>2012/12/13</p>
<p>I, by accident, wandered in front of the library when the second
evening class was to start. The light, on the first floor (note: printing room), which
was producing our papers continuously, was still on. I pushed,
with some difficulty, the heavy woody door, walked into the
machine-echoing room and came up to the maid, who was standing by
the printing machines, "I come here with the intention of returning
one yuan for the temporary in-and-out card. By the way, when should I fetch my new applied student card?" I inquired. She, with a rough voice,
answered directly." One yuan need not have been brought there.
Your application, I intend, will be met in unison with others'."
The machine clang nearly submerged her reply. The dim light
and the uncomfortable smell drove me away when I obtained her reply,
which was nearly submerged by the machinery clang.</p>
<p>As I can remember, a few days ago, I hurried here and entreated her, "My card was lost. Could you please..."</p>
<p>note(2020/5/9): The job at the printing room seems not to belong to official jobs and is provided with very low salary.</p>
<h2>Universities</h2>
<p>2021/12/18</p>
<p>The teacher asked us to fill our names in the chosen blank form, which listed important
domestic universities. Many cudgel their brains but made no final decision. Tai said, "
I can't focus my attention on schoolwork last class because I am incapable of
preventing myself from considering my prosperity." Hesitation is the woe to our
happiness, in every aspect of life.</p>
<p>Arrangement in advance is hard to fulfill adequately.
Some boys like Cheng Weizheng signed up for 8 universities (or more).
"You can't deal with all your choices, and will be destined to abandon
part by doomy situation." The teacher said.</p>
<p>When I cast my eyes on the crumpled form paper to seek the name of Tsinghua
University and another famout one. Tai (at my side) said casually,
"You don't need to do it. Everyone knows clearly your choice."</p>
<p>Sun Zhongkai, while proclaiming that the deliberate consideration of which
universities to attend takes up his limited time, was still cautiously choosing a few
destinations for himself. Without consciousness, we performed what we hated inwardly.</p>
