## Adventure
2021/4/4

Yesterday, after dinner, I went with Yang Bai to Xiangmi Park. However,
we went to the wrong place and placed ourselves in a construction site.
It seemed the site had only one entrance (exit).

## Focus on figures
2021/4/10

Recently, I read the book of Zuo continuously and focused on the figures
mentioned in the book. Most people have their entries in Chinese wikipedia.
Sometimes I added reference for these entries.

## Amazing translator
2021/4/18

Today I found an amazing translator, who is a freelancer but translated
the book "World of Plainness" by herself.
She often complains in the discussion group she created that
the career path for translators in China becomes harder. But she manages
to help those newcomers for their deserved rights. Translators
are often cheated by some bad companies. Sometimes the manuscript charges
can be returned only by legal way.

## Resume the relationship
2021/6/2

Last night I dwelt on the contents I needed to write to show
my sincereness towards Yang Bai. But after I got up, I found
it was difficult to start. To my pleasant surprise,
this afternoon Yang Bai apologized to me through wechat message.
I immediately accepted her expression. So our relationship resumes.

## Massive testing
2021/6/7

When I woke up this morning, I heard that negative Covid test result
became necessary for passengers leaving Shenzhen airport.
If this measure continued to the end of this month, it will definitely
influence my plan. I had not enough time to worry before Mr. Huang
told us in class that the massive testing for staffs and students in
the university town would take place tomorrow. I thought the testing
was not beneficial for students. But Mr. Huang claimed that it was
compulsory for students until you quit the education.

## CET 6 test
2021/6/12

This afternoon I went to take the CET 6 exam. By accident,
I met Kong Deqiang and Xiong Zhenwen. I made acquaintance with them
long time ago. The first is a sports figure in our campus. He is
famous for his running. As a senior phd student, on one hand,
he uses running to release his pressure in scientific research.
On the other hand, he loves this kind of sports. The second is
a third-year master student of TBSI. I was surprised when I heard
that his destination was not determined yet. Both of the two
had some tendency for the job of public service. Even for the track
of sole graduates of current year, the admitted ratio for one post is several
scores. The situation of Xiong is not so optimistic. Before he started his master
study, he had worked for six years in Shenzhen. As a result, he was not young now. Many
institutions have age limitation for applicants. So it becomes impossible for him
to apply for some positions. When we ate together after the exam in the village,
brother Kong encouraged Xiong not to be disappointed for his hard situation.
"There are many choices in each turning point of life. Some are secure while others
are risky. Secure ones make your life plain while risky choices bring some hope
for you to make greater achievement. Once determined, don't be afraid of your choices."
Kong said to us.
