## Adventure

Yesterday, after dinner, I went with Yang Bai to Xiangmi Park. However,
we went to the wrong place and placed ourselves in a construction site.
It seemed the site had only one entrance (exit).

## Focus on figures

Recently, I read the book of Zuo continuously and focused on the figures
mentioned in the book. Most people have their entries in Chinese wikipedia.
Sometimes I added reference for these entries.

## Amazing translator
2021/4/18

Today I found an amazing translator, who is a freelancer but translated
the book "World of Plainness" by herself.
She often complains in the discussion group she created that
the career path for translators in China becomes harder. But she manages
to help those newcomers for their deserved rights. Translators
are often cheated by some bad companies. Sometimes the manuscript charges
can be returned only by legal way.
