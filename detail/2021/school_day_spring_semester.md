## Adventure
2021/4/4

Yesterday, after dinner, I went with Yang Bai to Xiangmi Park. However,
we went to the wrong place and placed ourselves in a construction site.
It seemed the site had only one entrance (exit).

## Focus on figures
2021/4/10

Recently, I read the book of Zuo continuously and focused on the figures
mentioned in the book. Most people have their entries in Chinese wikipedia.
Sometimes I added reference for these entries.

## Amazing translator
2021/4/18

Today I found an amazing translator, who is a freelancer but translated
the book "World of Plainness" by herself.
She often complains in the discussion group she created that
the career path for translators in China becomes harder. But she manages
to help those newcomers for their deserved rights. Translators
are often cheated by some bad companies. Sometimes the manuscript charges
can be returned only by legal way.

## Resume the relationship
2021/6/2

Last night I dwelt on the contents I needed to write to show
my sincereness towards Yang Bai. But after I got up, I found
it was difficult to start. To my pleasant surprise,
this afternoon Yang Bai apologized to me through wechat message.
I immediately accepted her expression. So our relationship resumes.

## Massive testing
2021/6/7

When I woke up this morning, I heard that negative Covid test result
became necessary for passengers leaving Shenzhen airport.
If this measure continued to the end of this month, it will definitely
influence my plan. I had not enough time to worry before Mr. Huang
told us in class that the massive testing for staffs and students in
the university town would take place tomorrow. I thought the testing
was not beneficial for students. But Mr. Huang claimed that it was
compulsory for students until you quit the education.

## CET 6 test
2021/6/12

This afternoon I went to take the CET 6 exam. By accident,
I met Kong Deqiang and Xiong Zhenwen. I made acquaintance with them
long time ago. The first is a sports figure in our campus. He is
famous for his running. As a senior phd student, on one hand,
he uses running to release his pressure in scientific research.
On the other hand, he loves this kind of sports. The second is
a third-year master student of TBSI. I was surprised when I heard
that his destination was not determined yet. Both of the two
had some tendency for the job of public service. Even for the track
of sole graduates of current year, the admitted ratio for one post is several
scores. The situation of Xiong is not so optimistic. Before he started his master
study, he had worked for six years in Shenzhen. As a result, he was not young now. Many
institutions have age limitation for applicants. So it becomes impossible for him
to apply for some positions. When we ate together after the exam in the village,
brother Kong encouraged Xiong not to be disappointed for his hard situation.
"There are many choices in each turning point of life. Some are secure while others
are risky. Secure ones make your life plain while risky choices bring some hope
for you to make greater achievement. Once determined, don't be afraid of your choices."
Kong said to us.

## A brand-new path
2021/6/21

Yesterday Yang Bai told me that she was admitted by a promising lab of Berkley University
as a visiting student. This was a milestone for her plan of going aboard. If I was her
good friend, I would definitely congratulate her on such matter. But I was her boyfriend,
so I could not be happy when I heard the brand-new plan of Yang Bai: "Becoming post-doc
in USA if the research is smooth". I knew this was only an initial idea, and I was thankful
that she told me this possibility to me in advance instead of acting first and reporting afterwards.
But what I worried was that our life would become out of sync. A few months ago, I considered
a little about the possibility of going aboard for a post-doc position, and soon abandoned this
immature idea. For me now I only considered one path, entering Huawei or Alibaba in Beijing.

## A box of walnut
2021/6/23

This noon I saw xiangxiang was eating something in front of the trash can of our lab.
"What are you eating?" I asked him. "Walnut." He said while shelling the food in his hand.
As he pointed, I found a box of walnut in the food area of our lab. This is the only remaining
food on the surface of the cabinet. "Whose box of walnut?" I questioned him further.
"It's provided by myself." Xiangxiang said slowly.
"Nobody eats it except you, because everybody likes eating soft food while only you like eating
hard food." I commented. Actually this comment hints on the difference of research topic in our lab.
Xiangxiang seems to be the sole person to have some achievement in theoretical exploration while
others tend to pick topics on algorithm or application level. The latter sells much better than
the former when it comes to seeking a good job.

## The most difficult obstacle
2021/7/14

It is already two weeks since I came to Beijing. I gradually found that the most difficult obstacle for me is loneliness. My good friends are either in Shanghai or Shenzhen while my parents live in Guangzhou. When I tried to arrange some offline occasion for the reunion of friends from my junior school, they seem not to be available currently. In the evening before I went to sleep, I regularly read the poems of Du Fu. The topics of his poems are diversified. The ones which touch me most are those which expressed his memory about precious days in his youth when he travelled with friends. Du Fu was unable to do anything except expressing his feeling through writing when he became old. In my case, I felt more and more about the hypocrisy in social engagement, which disgusts me a lot. In some perspective it’s an art of contact, but it can also be understood as the encoded message
of communication. It’s indirect and you need to think for a while before you decipher its real intention. For example, in the company one colleague who sits nearby me suggests me to have more rest in the noon. But he follows his suggestion by the comment that the sound of my keyboard has high amplitude, which means that he is bothered while sleeping. Indeed, I have a earlier biological clock than my companions. I come earlier, eat lunch earlier, have a noon snap earlier and start using computer earlier.
