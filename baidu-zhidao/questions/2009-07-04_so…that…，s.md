# so…that…，such…that…
2009-07-04


Smith has made _______ that we are all surprised .  A. such much progress       B. so fine a progress   C. such a great progress as    D. so much progress选D怎么解释？为什么不用such……that……？


such与so的区别与用法 such与so的意思都是“如此，这样”。但两者用法根本不同，与what和how引导的感叹句相类似。 1、such后面主要是修饰名词。即：such＋e69da5e6ba90e799bee5baa6e997aee7ad9431333238663530a/an＋adj.＋n.或a/an＋such＋adj.＋n.。如果名词是不可数名词或复数名词，则不可以用不定冠词a或an。如： ①He has such a beautiful bike. We all go to see it. ②It's a such fine day. We al want to go to fly a kite. 2、so后面只能跟形容词或副词。即：和so＋adj.或adv.不过，so后面也可以跟名词，但该名词必须是单数可数名词。用法为：so+形容词+a或an+单数可数名词。如： ①The tiger is so big. And the cat is so small. ②She is so lovely a girl. 3、它们后面还可以与that从句连用。即：such…that和so…that意思是“如此……以至……”。如： ①She is such a clever girl that she can make much progress in math exam. ②His brother is so young that he can't go to school. 注：当名词前的形容词为表示数目的词时，such必须换成so。如： ①There are so many people that we can't go past. ②I ate so much food that I didn't want to go any farther. 注意这一句话：Smith has made  so much progress  that we are all surprised ..进步是不可数名词，因此用much（修饰不可数名词）. many修饰可数名词。so是副词,只能修饰形容词或副词。只有so能与much连用。一般来说，so many 和so much可以成为固定的词组PS：上面竟然有人说progress是可数名词。。。
